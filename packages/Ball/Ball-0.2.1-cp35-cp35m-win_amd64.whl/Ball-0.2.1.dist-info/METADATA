Hypothesis tests and sure independence screening (SIS) procedure based on ball statistics, including ball divergence , ball covariance , and ball correlation , 
are developed to analyze complex data in metric spaces, e.g, shape, directional, compositional and symmetric positive definite matrix data. The ball divergence 
and ball covariance based distribution-free tests are implemented to detecting distribution difference and association in metric spaces . Furthermore, several 
generic non-parametric feature selection procedures based on ball correlation, BCor-SIS and all of its variants, are implemented to tackle the challenge in the 
context of ultra high dimensional data.
