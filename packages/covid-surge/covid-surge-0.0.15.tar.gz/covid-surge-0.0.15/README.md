| Distribution of mortality critical surge periods for the states in US with the most evolved epidemics. There are 5 groups of states in US with similar surge periods. Groups are made within bins of 2 days width. The range of the critical period for US states is between 16 to 27 days. That is, the number of days that stresses the health system the most. Groups to the right are less stressed than groups to the left.|

| Distribution of mortality critical surge periods for the countries with the most evolved epidemics. There are 5 groups of countries in the world with similar surge periods. Groups are made within bins of 2 days width. The range of the critical period for the countries is between 17 to 29 days. That is, the number of days that stresses the health system the most. Groups to the right are less stressed than groups to the left.|
