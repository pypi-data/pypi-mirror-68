| Distribution of critical surge periods for the states in US with the most evolved epidemic. There are 5 groups in US with similar surge periods. Groups are made within bins of 2 days width. The range of the critical period for US states is between 15 to 27 days. That is, the number of days that stresses the health system the most. Groups to the right are less stressed than groups to the left.|
