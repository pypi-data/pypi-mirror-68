| Distribution of critical surge periods for the states in US with the most evolved epidemic. There are 6 groups in US with similar surge periods. Groups are made within bins of 2 days width. The range of the critical period for US states is between 16 to 26 days. That is, the number of days that stresses the health system the most. |
