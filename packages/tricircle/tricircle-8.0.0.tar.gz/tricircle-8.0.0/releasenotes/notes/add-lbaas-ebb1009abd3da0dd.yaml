    Support LBaaS in multi-region scenario. To enable adding instances as
    members with VIP, amphora routes the traffic sent from VIP to its
    gateway. However, in Tricircle, the gateway obtained from central neutron
    is not the real gateway in local neutron. As a result, only subnet
    without gateway is supported as member subnet. We will remove the
    limitation in the future, and LBaaS working together with Nova Cells V2
    multi-cells will also be supported in the future.
