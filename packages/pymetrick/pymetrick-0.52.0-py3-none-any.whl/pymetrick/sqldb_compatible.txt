tinyblob 	A blob column with a maximum length of 255 (2^8 - 1) bytes of data.
mediumblob 	A blob column with a maximum length of 16777215 (2^24 - 1) bytes of data.
longblob 	A blob column with a maximum length of 4294967295 (2^32 - 1) bytes of data.
text 	A string with a maximum length of 65535 (2^16 - 1) characters.
tinytext 	A text column with a maximum length of 255 (2^8 - 1) characters.
mediumtext 	A text column with a maximum length of 16777215 (2^24 - 1) characters.
longtext 	A text column with a maximum length of 4294967295 (2^32 - 1) characters.
enum 	An enumeration, which is a string object that takes a single value from a list of values that are declared when the table is created.
set 	Similar to an enumeration, a string object that can have zero or more values, each of which must be chosen from a list of allowed values that are specified when the table is created.
