Description: # Workoutizer
        
        The Workoutizer is a simple web application for organizing your workouts and sports activities. It is designed to work
        locally on any system running Python. Track your activities to get an overview of your overall training, similar to
        platforms like [strava](https://www.strava.com/) or [garmin connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) - but without
        uploading all your sensitive health data to some 3rd party cloud.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        To run the application, just clone the repo, navigate into the root of the repo and run
        
        ```bash
        docker-compose up
        ```
        and then open your browser at [http://0.0.0.0:8001/](http://0.0.0.0:8001/).
        
        
        ## Gallery 
        
        It comes bundled with some initial dummy activity data:
