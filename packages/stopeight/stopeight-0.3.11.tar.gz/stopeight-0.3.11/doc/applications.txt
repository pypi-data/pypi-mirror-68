Applications
============

It can be applied to a lot of different applications:

* Pen-Stroke Comparison
   :mod:`stopeight.legacy`: Extracts feature points. Reduces the amount of data points in a format suitable for overlay comparison using affine transformations. Status Partially working.

   Example: Recognising Asian characters. (See http://www.symboloh.com)
* Analyzing a time-based Series of Function Graph data
   :mod:`stopeight.grapher`: Turns a Function Graph into a Vector Graph. The Vector Graph can then be processed like a pen-stroke. Status Working.

   :mod:`stopeight.analyzer`: Makes a quadratic approximation of the Vector Graph similar to the legacy method above. Resolution independent version. Status Not yet implemented.

   Example: Frontend for non-realtime signal analysis.

In different fields:

* Pen-Stroke UI
* Signal Analysis
* Data Visualisation
