Editor
======

The editor is the main entry point to the code. Currently it allows for drawing, importing pen-stroke and WAV files. In the editor you can apply algorithms to the imported data. Launch it from the command line::

    $ python -m stopeight.util.editor.dispatch

Note: The comparator algorithms are currently not accessible from the editor. They are accessible through the API and the tests.
