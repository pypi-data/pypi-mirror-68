Stopeight Comparator
--------------------

The API is installed with stopeight.

To run the tests using the legacy frontend pooling is needed.

:mod:`stopeight.multiprocessing` is using the Python multiprocessing module. You can test if your Python installation and the underlying OS support this by running from within a Python shell::

    >>> from multiprocessing import synchronize

Unpack the legacy test files :doc:`sample-data`.

Run the test::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight
    >>> from stopeight.test.test_comparator import test_comparator
    >>> test_comparator()
