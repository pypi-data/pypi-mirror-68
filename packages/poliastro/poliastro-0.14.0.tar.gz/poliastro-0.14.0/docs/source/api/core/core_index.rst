Core level API
==============

The :py:mod:`poliastro.core` includes a set of modules that form the kernel of :py:mod:`poliastro`. All defined functions
in these modules work with `Numbaâ€™s JIT compiler` (`Numba web site <http://numba.pydata.org/>`__), since many of the computations
behind poliastro involve hard numerical methods. This is the Low-Level API of :py:mod:`poliastro`, being the basis of the High-Level API,
the one expected to be used.
