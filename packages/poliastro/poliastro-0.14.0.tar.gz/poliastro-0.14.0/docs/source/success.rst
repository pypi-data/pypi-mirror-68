    *"My team and I used Poliastro for our final project in our Summer App Space
    program. This module helped us in plotting asteroids by using the data
    provided to us. It was very challenging finding a module that can take
    orbits from the orbital elements, plot planets, and multiple ones. This
    module helped us because we were able to understand the code as most of us
    were beginners and make some changes the way we wanted our project to turn
    out. We made small changes such as taking out the axis and creating a
    function that will create animations. I am happy we used Poliastro because
    it helped us directs us in a direction where we were satisfied of our final
    product."*

    *"We are a group of students at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
    United States. We are currently working on a student AIAA/AAS satellite
    competition to design a satellite perform some science missions on
    asteroid (469219) 2016 HO3. We are using your poliastro python package in
    designing and visualizing the trajectory from GEO into asteroidâ€™s orbit.
    Thank you for your work on poliastro, especially the APIs that are very
    clear and informational, which helps us significantly."*

    *"We, at the Institute of Space and Planetary Astrophysics (ISPA,
    University of Karachi), are using Poliastro as part of Space Flight
    Dynamics Text Book development program. The idea is to develop a book
    suitable for undergrad students which will not only cover theoretical
    background but will also focus on some computational tools. We chose
    Poliastro as one of the packages because it was very well written and
    provided results with good accuracy. It is especially useful in covering
    some key topics like the Lambert's problem. We support the use of
    Poliastro and open source software because they are easily accessible to
    students (without any charges, unlike some other tools). A great plus
    point for Poliastro is that it is Python based and Python is now becoming
    a very important tool in areas related to Space Sciences and Technologies."*
