        Asynchronous Python client for [SolarEnergyÂ®](http://www.solarenergy.com.br) inverters.
        
        ## About
        
        This package allows you to monitor [SolarEnergyÂ®](http://www.solarenergy.com.br) inverters programmatically:
        
        * Equipment serial, model and general info
        * Temperature and inverter health
        * Real time power, current and voltage
        * Grid power information
        * Daily/Total energy summaries
        * Network summary
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install pysolarenergy
        ```
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        ```python
        import asyncio
        from pysolarenergy import SolarEnergyInverter
        
        
        async def main():
            """Show example of connecting to your inverter."""
            async with SolarEnergyInverter(host='192.168.1.22') as inverter:
                info = await inverter.get_info()
                print(info)
        
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            loop.run_until_complete(main())
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        ### Methods
        
        `get_info()`
        
        `get_real_time_data()`
        
        `get_network()`
        
        ## Confirmed Supported Inverters
        
        These inverters have been tested and confirmed to be working.  
        
        * SE-TL2K
        
        If your inverter is not listed above, this library may still work. Please create an issue so we can add your inverter to the list ðŸ˜Š.
