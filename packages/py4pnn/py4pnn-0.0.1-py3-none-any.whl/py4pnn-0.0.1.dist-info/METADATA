# py4pnn

Pseudo Nearest Neighbors Python Library

## Getting Started

This project is simply implementation of Pseudo Nearest Neighbors algorithm in python programming language.

### Prerequisites

This Project Has No Prerequisites


### Installing

The easiest way to install py4pnn is using pip

```
pip install py4pnn
```

### Usage
There is only 1 public method of pnn class. It is predict method, it takes 5 argument namely x_train, t_train, x_test, k, and distance calculation method. We provide 6 distance namely euclidean, squared_euclidean, manhattan, canberra, chebyshev, and bray_curtis.
```
from py4pnn.p_nearest_neighbors import pnn
classifier = pnn()
x_train=[[0.23,0.54],[0.45,1.23],[1.54,0.23],[0.93,0.535]]
t_train=[0,1,0,1]
x_test=[[0.34,0.65],[0.90,0.50]]
y=classifier.predict(x_train,t_train,x_test,1,'eclidean')
```
