# z3-tracker

**This is a development version in what you could call 'beta stage'. There will be bugs!**

### Description

z3-tracker is yet another tracker for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. It features

* item tracking,
* location tracking,
* entrance tracking,
* autotracking (limited to major items for now).

It supports every game mode of the VT8 randomiser except insanity entrance shuffle and boss shuffle.

### Installation

z3-tracker is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Note that the main development platform is Linux, while MacOS support is entirely untested.

##### Linux

Ensure that Python 3.6 or higher are available. z3-tracker also requires full tkinter support -- since tkinter is part of the core Python library, most distributions include it. If you are unsure, the quickest way to check is to try whether the command `python3 -c 'import tkinter.ttk'` is available.

You can run z3-tracker simply by running the z3-tracker.py script (i.e. `python3 z3-tracker.py`). Various other ways are available, including installing from PyPI (e.g. `pip3 install --user z3-tracker`).

##### Windows

You will need Python 3.6 or higher. You can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). When running the installer, check the button 'Add Python #.# to PATH'. Also be sure not to de-select tkinter during installation. If you've allowed the installer to associate PY files with Python 3, just double-clicking `z3-tracker.py` should suffice.

##### MacOS

No support for installation on MacOS can be given here, but it *should* run. As with the other operating systems, Python 3.6 or higher is required. Again, I can't give any further details as to how to install that and run z3-tracker on MacOS.

##### Autotracking support

In order two be able to use autotracking, two external components need to be available: websockets and QUsb2snes.

z3-tracker will work without these, but autotracking won't be available.

###### Websockets

Autotracking in z3-tracker depends on the Python websockets module. This library enables z3-tracker to communicate with QUsb2snes.

The easiest cross-platform way to install websockets is pip. In Windows, open CMD (on Windows 10: right-click Windows button → 'Command Prompt'). On Linux and Mac OS, open a terminal. Then type: 'pip3 install --user websockets'. That's it. (You might encounter a warning informing you that pip is out of date. For the purpose of running z3-tracker, you can safely ignore this message.)

Most Linux distribution also distribute it via their package manager under names like 'python3-websockets' (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora) or 'python-websockets' (Arch).

###### QUsb2snes

You need to install and run [QUsb2snes](https://skarsnik.github.io/QUsb2snes/#installation). This program is the de-facto standard for features like autotracking or multiworld. Despite its name, QUsb2snes does not require using an SD2SNES -- it also works with several PC-based emulators. Please check the linked documentation for further details.

Once started, make sure that QUsb2snes is connected with your console or emulator. If QUsb2snes can't find your device, z3-tracker won't either.

##### Config files

z3-tracker creates a config directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\z3-tracker` in Windows, `~/.z3-tracker` everywhere else). Storage requirements will be unnoticable. While modifying these files is perfectly fine, it is also entirely unsupported and most likely won't survive a version update.

### Usage

##### General layout

![Menu](screenshots/menu.png)

In order to allow as much flexibility as possible in the placement of various parts of z3-tracker, a multi-window layout is used. That means that every component of the tracker opens its own window. Since z3-tracker uses tkinter (i.e. Tcl), it behaves a little bit outdated -- you can't really resize the windows. (On the other hand, using tkinter means that you don't have to install additional GUI libraries.)

##### Supported modes

* entrance shuffle (except insanity)
* all four world states
* non-glitched and glitched rulesets, although support for glitched modes is limited
* basic and advanced item placement
* swordless
* all four dungeon item modes
* all five goals
* basic enemy shuffle (but not boss shuffle)
* Ganon's Tower/Ganon crystal requirements
* major item only shuffle
* shop-sanity (yet unreleased at time of writing)

##### Items and dungeons

![Items](screenshots/items.png)

![Dungeons](screenshots/dungeons.png)

Everything should be self-explanatory. Left-click and right-click the various objects to activate, deactivate, increase or decrease them. Certain items are grouped together on the same spot, e.g. both boomerangs or Shovel and Ocarina. These reflect their grouping in the game's item menu. Some functionality in the dungeon tracker like key counting is only shown if certain settings like key-sanity are selected.

Crystal requirements can be set at the bottom right of the dungeon tracker window.

##### Map locations

![Item Map](screenshots/item_map.png)

If entrance randomiser is activated, big round symbols denote overworld items. You can left-click them to mark and unmark them as checked. An explanation of the symbol colours is provided in the in-program help.

There are also other types of generic item locations, but these are only shown if entrance randomiser is disabled.

Colour coding:

* Red: Location is not available.
* Cyan: Location is available.
* Rose: Location is logically available, but requires finishing at least one dungeon before it can be reached.
* Green: Depending on item placement, location might be available. Or not.
* Yellow: Item is not available, but visible.
* Grey: Location has already been ticked off.

If both rose and green would be appropriate then green takes precedence.

##### Entrance locations

![Dungeon Map](screenshots/dungeon_map.png)

Entrances are marked as small squares. Just like with item locations, they can be left-clicked to mark them as checked or unchecked (although it is up to the user as to find a suitable meaning of 'checked' in this case).

However, entrances also support two more actions:

* Middle-clicking an entrance and then middle-clicking another (or the same) entrance will connect the entrance of the first-clicked location with the interior of the second-clicked one. Right-clicking on any point in the map that is not a button aborts the connection process.
* If an entrance is right-clicked on, any connection that this exterior location might have is removed.

When moving the mouse over an entrance with an established connection, the borders of various other (or the same) entrances may change colour. The meaning of these colours is explained in the in-program help.

##### Dungeons

Dungeons are big squares with a smaller inset square. They generally follow the same colours as items (which are explained in the in-program help). The inner square denotes whether the item reward is available, while the outer square shows whether all items in the dungeon can be collected. The outer square does not take any potential item on the boss into account.

Dungeon buttons can't be interacted with. They are controlled via the dungeon tracker.

##### Retro mode

![Retro Mode](screenshots/retro.png)

Retro includes certain entrance buttons relevant to this mode even if entrance randomiser is switched off. They represent shops and potential take-any caves. In this case these buttons do not offer any functionality beyond left-clicking.

#### Major items only

This option assumes that only major item locations are shuffled. All locations which do not contain major items in an unmodified game are therefore removed from the maps.

##### Autotracking

z3-tracker contains autotracking functionality. At time of writing, only items are tracked. In order to enable autotracking, ensure that the python websocket package is installed and available and that [QUsb2snes](https://github.com/Skarsnik/QUsb2snes) is running correctly on port 8080. You can then enable autotracking in the settings and choose a device to track. A status message in the main menu will tell you the current status of the autotracker.

Note that the autotracker updates at a fixed interval of about five seconds. That means once you picked up an item, it will take up to five seconds until it will appear on the item menu.

At the bottom of the item window, a button 'Auto' will appear. Its colour depends on the autotracking status:
* blue: autotracker is connected and tracking items
* orange: autotracker is connected but the game is currently not in a state to allow autotracking or the game isn't running at all
* red: autotracker could not connect to the console/emulator/QUsb2snes

If you click on the button, you can temporarily switch autotracking off for this window. This will allow you to temporarily use this window manually. Clicking on the button again will switch back to autotracking and wipe any manual changes you made.

To disable autotracking entirely, just uncheck the respective option in the settings.

### Saving

##### Autosaving

While some may have noticed the Save and Load buttons, most users should not need them. z3-tracker stores progress automatically everytime something changes. When z3-tracker is closed and restarted, this autosave is restored.

##### Manual saving and loading

If you wish to track several states at the same time, you can also create dedicated save files using the Save button. The Load button restores any save file -- but in order to do so, it closes z3-tracker. You have to restart it manually, I'm afraid. (Sorry, the Load button is just a fringe use case to begin with.)

##### Resetting

The Reset button clears all progress *and deletes the autosave*. Note that changing settings will not cause a reset (but vigorously switching between entrance randomiser and Retro will probably cause some display issues).

### Issues/bugs

A project like this will always come with a plethora of bugs -- especially on weirder settings. However, there are a few areas where users should be especially careful:

* Inverted crossworld shuffle (and inverted in general) probably has issues for locations which require Moon Pearl. This is just a matter of me forgetting some bush or pot somewhere.
* Support for glitched modes is limited. I do not wish to claim to be an authority on the rules applying to these modes, so I only included glitches which are clearly part of the item randomiser code -- which means not very many, since that code is not designed to contain such information. Major glitches especially mostly boils down to frame clipping without Pegasus Shoes and Bottle Music.
* Hearts and Bottles beyond the first one are currently not tracked. This is only an issue in basic item placement where a few dungeons and bosses require a certain number of hearts and bottles. Some of these will therefore be marked as available earlier than they should.
* The rulesets for small keys don't strictly follow the randomiser's approach of 'most stupid use' possible, although it doesn't necessarily assume the smartest one either.
* Insanity entrance shuffle is not supported. While z3-tracker internally knows the difference between going in and going out, I couldn't come up with a good user interface.
* Possession of bombs (or rather the ability to damage enemies) isn't consistently checked (but the randomiser assumes bombs to always be available anyway).
* While the randomiser always requires Silver Arrows for defeating Ganon, z3-tracker only does so for basic item placement. This is by design.
* In case somebody is wondering what the enemiser option is for: East Palace, Dark Palace and Ganon's Tower have slight changes in rules to account for the absence of Eyegores.
* Many people who have only come in contact with the the Twitch-centred community surrounding the VT8 randomiser and their nomenclature will probably find some location names unfamiliar.

Bugs may be reported on Github. Bug reports should include the contents of the config directory. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also take a look at the ruleset/vt8 directory. This is where the actual location rules reside. They should be easy to read.
