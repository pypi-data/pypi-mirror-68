        Install
        -------
        To install, grab the package and install the Jupyter KernelSpec as follows:
        ```bash
        pip install nbsafety
        ```
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Because `nbsafety` is implemented as a custom Jupyter kernel, it works for
        both Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab.
        To run an `nbsafety` kernel, select "Python 3 (nbsafety)" from the list
        of notebook types in Jupyter's "New" dropdown dialogue:

        For JupyterLab, similarly select "Python 3 (nbsafety)" from the list
        of available kernels in the Launcher tab:

        Uninstall
        ---------
        In addition to `pip uninstall nbsafety`, it is also necessary
        to deregister the kernel from Jupyter for a full uninstall:
        ```bash
        jupyter kernelspec uninstall nbsafety
        ```
