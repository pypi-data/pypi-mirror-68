Description: # json-five
        
        JSON5 for Python
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        >>> import json5
        >>> json_text = """{ // This is a JSON5 comment
        "foo": "bar" /* this is a JSON5 block
        comment that can span lines /*
        "bacon": "eggs"
        }
        """
        >>> json5.loads(json_text)
        {"foo": "bar", "bacon": "eggs"}
        ```
        
        ## Project goals
        
        - support a similar interface to the `json` module with support for JSON5 sources
        - support round-trip preservation of comments
        
        ## Status/milestones
        
        This project is in very early stages of development. The following are some 
        milestones that hopefully will be able to be marked as done as development progresses.
        
        - [x] parse json5 to Python (ignoring comments)
          - [x] line comments
          - [x] block comments
          - [x] numeric literals
          - [x] trailing commas for arrays and objects
          - [x] line continuations
          - [x] ecma identifiers as object keys
          - [x] leading plus for numbers
          - [x] single quoted strings
          - [x] escape characters in strings
        - [ ] dump python to JSON (no comment support)
          - [x] indent style (that matches `json`)
          - [ ] style options (quotes, trailing commas, etc)
          - [ ] helper classes for dumping types as other literals (hexadecimal numbers, identifiers, etc)
          - [ ] support similar options to `json` (e.g. `object_hook`, `parse_x`, `strict`, `ensure_ascii`, etc)
          - [ ] string escapes according to quote style
        - [ ] support manipulation of json model (e.g. to add/edit comments)
        - [ ] dump json model with comments
        - [ ] preserve comments when loading json5 (round-trip support)
        
        ...
        
        - [ ] Optimize with a C/Cython version
