`brainrender` is a python package for the visualization of three dimensional neuroanatomical from publicly available dataset (e.g. Allen Brain atlas) and from user generated experimental data. 
The goal of brainrender is to faciliate the exploration and communication of neuroanatomical data by providing a user-friendly
platform to create 3D renderings. 


For more information about `brainrender` and how to use it, checkout the [brainrender preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.961748v1).
You can find interactive examples of data visualisations generated with brainrender [here](https://fedeclaudi.github.io/br-info.html) and a gallery of images created with brainrender [here](https://fedeclaudi.github.io/br-gallery.html).


### Recent news
  * we've added the possibility to export brainrender scene to .html to embed ineractive data visualisations online. Check out these [examples](https://fedeclaudi.github.io/br-mouse.html) and learn how to export your scene with this [demo](Examples/export/export_for_web.py).
  * we're working to add support for custom atlases to works on datasets from species other than the mouse! Read on [here](Docs/custom_atlases.md) for more details.

# Installation
To install `brainrender`, use an existing python environment or [create](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) one [with `python < 3.8`] and install with:
```
pip install brainrender
```


# Description
## Publicly available datasets
One of the main goal of `brainrender` is to provide a single platform to explore anatomical data from many
publicly available datasets. Given that `brainrender` was initially developed for working on mouse data, most 
features involve datasets of anatomical data for the mouse brain.  
We are however in the process of **adding support for custom atlases**. This is already possible for a couple example ([read here for more info](Docs/custom_atlases.md)), and we will be adding more in the near future. Meanwhile get in touch for any feature request!

Below is a quick description of some of the things that `brainrender` can be used for when working with data from the mouse brain. 

## Allen Mouse Brain Atlas
Anatomical and projection data is downloaded from the  Allen Brain Atlas [reference atlas](http://atlas.brain-map.org)
and [connectivity atlas](http://connectivity.brain-map.org) using the Allen [API](http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/Allen%2BBrain%2BAtlas%2BAPI)
(Â© 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Brain Atlas API. Available from: [brain-map.org/api/index.html](brain-map.org/api/index.html)) ([1], [2]).

### Brain structures
Brain structures are the most fundamental element of any `brainrender` scene. You can use brainrender to select which brain regions you'd like to visualise, and how they should look (color, transparency...). Brainrender then takes care of downloading and rendering the 3D mesh for the selected regions. 

[example: [brain_regions.py](Examples/mouse/brain_regions.py)]



### Efferent projections (Streamlines)
Efferent anatomical projections  from a region of interest as determined by local injections of an anterogradely transported virus (see [Allen's connectivity atlas](http://connectivity.brain-map.org)) can be rendered as 'streamlines'.

Streamlines reconstructions are made by [https://neuroinformatics.nl](https://neuroinformatics.nl) using the mouse connectome data from Allen (see [here](https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/allen-connectivity-viewer/streamline-downloader.html) for more details). 
Brainrender automatically downloads and renders streamlines data for a brain region of interest. 

[example: [streamlines.py](Examples/mouse/streamlines.py)]

### Afferent projections (tractography)
The same data used to extract information about efferent projections, can be visualised in an alternative way to look at afferent projections to a region of interest. In `brainrender` this type of data visualisation is called tractography. 
Brainrender can be used to select the subset of experiment (injection of an anterograde virus expressing a fluorescent marker) which resulted in fluorescence in the region of interest from the >1000 experiments in the Allen Mouse Connectome project. 
The location of virus injection and the projection from that location to the region of interest is then displayed. 

[example: [tractography.py](Examples/mouse/tractography.py)]



### Volumetric projections
Brainrender can now use the model from [4] to visualise projection spatialised projections from one (or more) source brain region to one (or more) target brain region. By that we mean that you can see where in the target brainregion you have the strongest projections from the source region, as shown in this example:

MOs to STR             |  SSs to STR          |   SSp to STR

## Mouselight neuronal reconstructions
`Brainrender` can be used to download and render
neurons morphological data from Janelia's [mouse light](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight) database
(see the [neurons browser](http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org)). [3]
These reconstructions are aligned to the Allen brain atlas, so the neurons morphology can be visualised along other types of data (e.g. efferent/afferent projections) in `brainrender`.

[example: [mouselight.py](Examples/mouse/mouselight.py)]

## User generated content
Brainrender can be used to visualise data generated within individual labs, such as the results of a tracing experiments. 



Injection site             |  Labelled neurons
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/inj_site.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainREnder/raw/master/Docs/Media/labelled_cells.png)

This often requires that the raw data be registered to the Allen atlas (or any other atlas supported by brainrender), before being visualised.
This functionality is not supported in `brainrender`, however brainrender can be used to visualise data registered with other packages such as `amap` ([github repo](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/amap-python)) and `cellfinder` ([github repo](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/cellfinder)).


You can also use brainrender to visualise data from experiments done on **species other than the mouse.** Read on [here](Docs/custom_atlases.md for more details about how to do that.



You can also use `brainrender` to visualise the position of devices implanted in the brain (e.g. optic cannula). 
This can only be done by rendering colored cylinders at the location where the implant is or by loading in 3d 
rendering of the implanted devices from .obj or .stl files.

Thanks to @tbslv's contribution brainrender can be integrated with SharpTrack from the Cortex Lab [https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF] to visualise the location of implanted neuropixel probes. 




## Making figures
Brainrender's high quality renderings can be exported as `.png` images directly within brainrender.
Brainrender's flexibility when it comes to specify the appearance of rendered objects means that it can easily be used to display data as well as create schematics for scientific publications.

Brainrender can also be used to create videos and animations, check out the examples to see how you can create videos from within brainrender.

# Behind the scenes
Brainrender was deisgned to be a powerful and flexible software for downloading and rendering neuroanatomical data while still being relatively easy to use (using brainrender requires minimal coding experience). 
This was achieved by: 
  1) handling the interaction with the API, SDK and databases services used to find and download the data behind the scenes, requiring minimal user input. 
  2) Using [vtkplotter](https://vtkplotter.embl.es) to handle the rendering. Vtkplotter  ([github repo](https://github.com/marcomusy/vtkPlotter)) is a powerful rendering engine that produces high quality three dimensional rendering. Vtkplotter is also flexible, meaning that it can handle data provided in various file formats, allowing `brainrender` to render data from various sources.
