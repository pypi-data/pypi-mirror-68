Usage
=====

To use Python client for Degreed API in a project::

    from degreedClient import DegreedApiClient


The degreed api has got various modules which this client made available, however each module requires a specific ``scope`` for that module. The scope is something similar to this: ``users:read`` it may also look like this: ``users_read`` Degreed confirmed through their `documentation`_ that all methods will be supported, well at least for now but l recommend the first method of using a colon as a dimiliter.

.. _documentation: https://api.degreed.com/docs/#release-april-2019


To be able to use Degreed's api you will need the ``client_id`` , ``client_secret`` and also the ``host`` .The client id and client secret are given by Degreed Technical Solutions Specialist. The host has got a development host as well as production host. The hostname uses the format ``degreed.com`` and for betatest(development) it is in the format ``betatest.degreed.com`` .You get all these from Degreed. The API uses OAuth 2.0 protocolâ€™s Client Credentials Flow, you can get more information via `Degreed`_ official documentation.
