      <description>
        The time before which data will be read from the base storage.  This is
        of the form: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS, where trailing time data is
        optional. That is: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM,
        YYYY-MM-DDTHH, and YYYY-MM-DD, are all valid forms.   Also valid is
        the case-insensitive string 'now', which is the same as not passing an
        argument.  Also, the case-insensitive argument 'startup' opens the
        storage as of the time at module load.  This is to prevent a possible
        window ibetween the opening of the underlying filestorage and the
        opening of the beforestorage.

    <key name="before-from-file" datatype="string" required="no">
      <description>
        An absolute path to a file used to track the 'before' time. If the file
        exists it should contain the before time to use. Note that unlike the
        'before' option, 'now' and 'startup' cannot be used here.
        If the file does not exist, it'll be created and written with the
        current time.
