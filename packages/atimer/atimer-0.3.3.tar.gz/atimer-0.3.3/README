The `atimer` library implements asynchronous timer Python coroutine
based on POSIX timers. The coroutine can be used with Python `asyncio
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ module API.

The main features are

- expires at regular intervals
- tracks number of expirations if a long running task causes overrun
- starts synchronized with system clock at the edge of an interval
- measures time while system is suspended
