Description: The `atimer` library implements asynchronous timer Python coroutine
        based on POSIX timers. The coroutine can be used with Python `asyncio
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ module API.
        
        The main features are
        
        - expires at regular intervals
        - tracks number of expirations if a long running task causes overrun
        - starts synchronized with system clock at the edge of an interval
        - measures time while system is suspended
