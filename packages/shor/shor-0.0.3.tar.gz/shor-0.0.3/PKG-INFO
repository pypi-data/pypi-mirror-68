Description: # shor
        The Python quantum computing library.
        
        Shor is a simple, modular, and extensible quantum computing API written in python.
        
        #### Our mission is to make quantum computing easy and accesible to everyone.
        
        
        Use shor if you need a library that:
        - Enables fast prototyping of quantum circuits
        - Simulates small quantum programs
        - Makes quantum computing easy
        
        
        In the near future we plan to support running your programs on real world quantum computers.
        Write your program once, and run it anywhere.
