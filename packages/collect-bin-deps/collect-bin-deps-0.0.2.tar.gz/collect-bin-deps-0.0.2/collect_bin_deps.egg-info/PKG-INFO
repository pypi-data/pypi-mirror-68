Description: collect-bin-deps.py
        ===================
        A tool to collect binary dependencies - typically shared libraries required by
        an executable.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        * `pefile`, `pyelftools` package
        
        Usage
        -----
        Simplest case:
        
            collect-bin-deps.py -t <my exe file> <directory with dependency>...
        
        Notes
        -----
        * The "debug info" doesn't try to locate the debug info file using the information
          contained in the binaries or so, it just looks for files with the same basename
          as a dependency but with extensions used for debug info files.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        * Currently supports Windows (PE) and Linux (ELF) binaries.
        
        Inspiration
        -----------
        vcpkg can provide this functionality out of the box, realized with a
        PowerShell script. collect-bin-deps.py qs written from scratch to provide the
        same functionality.
