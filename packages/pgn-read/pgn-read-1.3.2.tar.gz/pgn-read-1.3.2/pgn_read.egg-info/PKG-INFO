        Description
        ===========
        
        This package provides a parser for chess game scores in `PGN`_ format.
        
        Both the strict export format and many less strict import formats are supported.
        
        Classes for handling a single game and files of games are provided.
        
        These classes verify that a game score represents a legal game.
        
        
        Installation Instructions
