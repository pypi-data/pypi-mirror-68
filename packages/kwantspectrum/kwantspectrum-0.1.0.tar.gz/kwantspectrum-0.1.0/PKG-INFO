Description: About kwantSpectrum
        ===================
        
        kwantSpectrum is an extension to `Kwant <http://kwant-project.org/>`__ that
        adaptively analyzes band structures of infinite quasi-1d systems.  The
        bandstructure is approximated to an arbitrary precision by piecewise cubic
        polynomials.  Functionality to deal with special points, intervals, and the
        periodic nature of the spectrum is provided.
        
        
        kwantSpectrum is distributed under the `2-clause BSD license <https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/kwantspectrum/-/blob/master/LICENSE.rst>`_

        Installation
        ############
        
        This section covers the installation of kwantSpectrum on a GNU/Linux
        system as Debian and Ubuntu via the command line.
        
        Requirements
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        kwantSpectrum has following non-Python dependency:
        
        - `Kwant <https://kwant-project.org/>`__
        
        Kwant can be installed with the following command::
        
           sudo apt-add-repository -s ppa:kwant-project/ppa
           sudo apt-get update
           sudo apt-get install python3-kwant
        
        kwantSpectrum requires at least Python 3.5. The following packages must
        be installed to build kwantSpectrum:
        
        - `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_
        - `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_
        
        Most packages can be installed from the command line
        by the standard Python package manager `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ via::
        
            sudo pip3 install numpy scipy
        
        Testing requirements
        --------------------
        The kwantSpectrum test suite requires the following Python packages:
        
        - `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_
        - `pytest-cov <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
        - `pytest-flake8 <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-flake8/>`_
        
        
        The packages can be installed by the standard *pip* command::
        
            sudo pip3 install pytest pytest-cov pytest-flake8
        
        Documentation requirements
        --------------------------
        Building the documentation requires the following Python packages:
        
        - `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
        - `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_
        - `jupyter-sphinx <https://jupyter-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
        
        
        The packages can be installed by the standard *pip* command::
        
            sudo pip3 install matplotlib sphinx jupyter-sphinx
        
        Building kwantSpectrum
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        kwantSpectrum can be installed from PyPI with::
        
            sudo pip3 install kwantspectrum
        
        Alternatively, it can be installed directly from the source code repository::
        
            sudo pip3 install git+https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/kwantspectrum.git
        
        For development, kwantSpectrum can be cloned from the official repository with::
        
            git clone https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/kwantspectrum.git
        
        Test suite
        ----------
        
        Unittests can be run directly in the local source repository from the command line::
        
            pytest
        
        
        Building the documentation
        --------------------------
        
        The documentation can be build directly in the ``/doc`` folder of the 
        local source repository from the command line::
        
            make html
        
        The generated html documentation can be browsed
        by opening the file ``doc/build/html/index.html`` with a web browser.
