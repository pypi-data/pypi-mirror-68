        General description
        -------------------
        
        PseuToPy is a Python library which defines a grammar for a
        pseudocode-based pseudocode. With this grammar, PseuToPy is then able to
        take instructions written in pseudocode and converts it into the
        equivalent Python instructions.
        
        PseuToPy is designed for educational purposes. In that sense, PseuToPy
        is suited to anyone embarking in the journey of learning Python
        programming by offering a relaxed syntax and a grammar that very much
        resembles the grammar of a natural language.
        
        This repository is a rebuild of 
        `this one <https://github.com/PatWg/PseuToPy>`__, with a new grammar file that
        is taken from the Python 3.8 grammar definition.
        
        The development is still on-going to catch up with the aforementioned
        repository. But once this new project reaches (or surpasses) the state of the
        former project, I will migrate the old project's code into this repository
        here, so as to keep the names of the inital contributors.
