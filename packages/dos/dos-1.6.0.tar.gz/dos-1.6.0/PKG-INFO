        ## Introduction
        
        dos is a Python package to make it easy to document and validate a Flask API. Write a single chunk of code to create 
        endpoints with both built in validation and automatically generated documentation. The documentation is Open API 3.0 
        (formerly known as Swagger) in JSON form. 
        
        ## Installation 
        
        You can install the latest version of dos with pip.
        
        ```bash
        pip install dos
        ```
        
        ## Hello World
        
        > All of this code is found in the [pet_shop](https://github.com/pr/dos/tree/master/examples/tutorial/pet_shop) example. 
        > For a more substantive look at dos, please see [dos in depth](#dos-in-depth)
        
        Let's look at the structure of a typical dos endpoint. The following code defines the `/dog/get` endpoint.
        
        ```python
        from http import HTTPStatus
        from dos.schema import ErrorFields
        from pet_shop.model import DogFields
        
        def handler():
        
            # ... database query looking for the dog ...
        
            if dog_found:
                dog = {
                    "name": "Spot",
                    "breed": "Poodle"
                }
                return HTTPStatus.OK, dog
            else:
                return HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND, {"message": "No dog by that name found!"}
        
        
        def input_schema():
            return DogFields().specialize(only=["name"])
        
        
        def output_schema():
            return {
                HTTPStatus.OK: DogFields().all(),
                HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND: ErrorFields().all()
            }
        ```
        
        Each endpoint is made up of 3 critical components. 
        
        1. `handler()`
        
        The handler defines the endpoint functionality. Adding to the database, calling another endpoint, it all happens here.
        
        2. `input_schema()`
        
        The input_schema defines what fields the endpoint expects. These are typically defined elsewhere and imported, but they
        don't have to be.
        
        3.  `output_schema()`
        
        The output_schema defines what fields the endpoint is allowed to expose. Critically, if the handler sets a field that is 
        not defined in the output_schema, that field will not be exposed by the API. Because endpoints can produce different HTTP 
        statuses, the output_schema is a dictionary where the keys are all the statuses produced by the endpoint.
        
        ---
        
        The endpoints import fields typically defined in another file. Here is the DogFields class from above.
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        from dos.schema import Fields
        
        class DogFields(Fields):
            base_schema = {
                "name": prop.String("The dog's name."),
                "breed": prop.String("The dog's breed.")
            }
        
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(self.base_schema)
        ```
        
        Every Fields class needs to have a base_schema, a dictionary made up of dos props. Read more about props [here](#props).
        
        The Field class gives additional functionality outlined [here](#the-field-class).
        
        ---
        
        Now that we've defined an endpoint, we can create out flask app. It will look something like this: 
        
        ```python
        from dos.open_api import OpenAPI
        from dos.flask_wrappers import wrap_validation, wrap_handler, wrap_route
        from flask import Flask, jsonify, render_template
        
        from pet_shop.api.dog import get as dog_get
        
        def create_app():
            app = Flask(__name__)
            open_api = OpenAPI("Pet Shop API", "1.0")
        
            handler_mapping = [
                (dog_get, "/dog/get", "get"),
            ]
        
            for module, path, http_method in handler_mapping:
                handler = wrap_handler(module.__name__, module.handler)
                handler = wrap_validation(handler, module)
                wrap_route(app, handler, path, http_method)
                open_api.document(module, path, http_method)
        
            @app.route("/")
            def index():
                return render_template("index.html")
        
            @app.route("/docs")
            def docs(): 
                return render_template("docs.html")
        
            @app.route("/open_api.json")
            def open_api_endpoint():
                return jsonify(open_api)
        
            return app
        
        ```
        
        This will create a flask app with the endpoint we just defined, as well as documenting it with Open API 3.0 JSON. 
        
        For more about the Flask Wrappers, please look [here](#flask-wrappers)
        
        That's all there is to it. Once the general structure is set up, each additional endpoint should be relatively simple 
        to implement.

        ## dos in Depth
        
        ### Props
        
        The foundation of dos is props. There are nine different prop types, 6 which are represented by Open API:
        
        Name | Python Type | OpenAPI Representation | Additional Notes
        --- | --- | --- | ---
        Integer | `int` | Yes
        Number | `int`, `float`, `decimal.Decimal` | Yes
        Numeric | `int`, `float`, `decimal.Decimal`, `str` | No | The string must contain a valid number
        String | `str` | Yes
        DateTime | `str`, `arrow.Arrow` | No | The string must contain a valid arrow DateTime
        Enum | `enum.Enum` | No
        Boolean | `bool` | Yes
        Object | `dict` | Yes
        Array | `list` | Yes
        
        Props are used to capture the structure of the inputs and outputs of endpoints.
        
        Initializing a Prop is simple, and is always done in the context of a python dictionary 
        capturing the structure of the JSON.
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        
        base_schema = {
            "name": prop.String(),
        }
        ```
        
        #### Customizing Props
        
        Props take four optional arguments. 
        Description is a string explaining what the prop represents, and is displayed in the documentation.
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        
        base_schema = {
            "name": prop.String(description="The dog's name."),
        }
        ```
        
        Required and nullable capture whether the prop is required and nullable. These are used for both validation and Open API.
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        
        base_schema = {
            "name": prop.String(required=False, nullable=True),
        }
        ```
        
        All props have these three arguments, and a final one called validators.
        
        #### Prop Validation 
        
        dos has a few validators built in as exemplars, but feel free to write your own Validators, specific to the domain your API is capturing.
        
        All validators define `supported_prop_classes`, because not all validation is applicable to every prop. 
        (You wouldn't validate if an array was a Social Security Number!) 
        
        Using a Validator looks like this:
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        from dos.validators import ExactLength
        
        base_schema = {
            "name": prop.String("This string must be 8 characters long", validators=ExactLength(8)),
        }
        ```
        
        The validator itself looks like this:
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        from dos.validators import Validator
        
        class ExactLength(Validator):
            supported_prop_classes = [prop.String, prop.Number, prop.Numeric, prop.Integer]
        
            def __init__(self, exact_length=None):
                self.exact_length = exact_length
        
            def validate_prop(self, prop_class, prop_value):
                super().validate_prop(prop_class, prop_value)
        
                if len(prop_value) != self.exact_length:
                    return (f"{prop_class.__name__} is not the correct length! The string \'{prop_value}\' is "
                            f"{len(prop_value)} characters long, not {self.exact_length}!")
        
                return None
        ```
        
        Every validator needs to define `supported_prop_classes` and a `validate_prop` function. 
        
        If you have a good one, feel free to submit a pull request.
        
        #### Objects and Arrays
        
        Objects and Arrays take additional arguments, due to their special nature.
        
        Objects take their structure, looking something like this: 
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        
        base_schema = {
            "name": prop.Object(structure={
                "name": prop.String("The object has a string in it"),
                "boolean_field": prop.Boolean("And also a boolean")
            }),
        }
        ```
        
        Structure is mandatory, and is a dictionary of props. Validation will look for dictionaries in the JSON that match the 
        outlined structure.
        
        Array does a similar thing with the repeated_structure argument. 
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        
        base_schema = {
            "names": prop.Array(repeated_structure=prop.String("just a list of strings")),
        }
        ```
        
        You can even put these together, and have an array of objects!
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        
        base_schema = {
            "names": prop.Array(repeated_structure=prop.String("just a list of strings")),
            "array_of_objects": prop.Array(
                repeated_structure=prop.Object(
                    structure={
                        "sub_string": prop.String("the string", required=True, nullable=False),
                        "required_one": prop.String(required=True, nullable=False)
                    }
                ),
                description="A list of plans."
            )
        }
        ```
        
        #### Prop Wrappers
        
        Prop Wrappers are another way to capture what a JSON field expects. Currently, they are used for fields with multiple valid inputs.
        
        Say a field can take either a string or a boolean. dos captures this idea with a prop wrapper.
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        from dos import prop_wrapper
        
        base_schema = {
            "boolean_or_string": prop_wrapper.OneOf([
                prop.String(),
                prop.Boolean()
            ]),
        }
        ```
        
        Critically, the OneOf prop wrapper is a just an array of props, meaning all the customization outlined above is still possible.
        A convoluted example could be something like this:
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        from dos import prop_wrapper
        from dos.validators import ExactLength
        
        base_schema = {
            "boolean_or_string": prop_wrapper.OneOf([
                prop.String(validators=ExactLength(7)),
                prop.Boolean(required=False, nullable=False)
            ]),
        }
        ```
        
        All of this is enforced and valid. 
        
        ### The Field Class 
        
        Fields are a collection of Props and Prop Wrappers that make up an object. They are a way to give semantically meaningful names to 
        collections of Props and Prop Wrappers, and capture the object oriented nature of some APIs. 
        
        ```python
        from dos import prop
        from dos.schema import Fields
        
        class DogFields(Fields):
            base_schema = {
                "name": prop.String("The dog's name."),
                "breed": prop.String("The dog's breed.")
            }
        
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__(self.base_schema)
        ```
        
        All fields need a base_schema, which is where the Props and Prop Wrappers that make up the collection are stored.
        
        #### Field Customization 
        
        The Fields class gives many opportunities for customization of input and output schema.
        
        ```python
        from http import HTTPStatus
        from pet_shop.model import DogFields
        
        def input_schema():
            return DogFields().specialize(only=["name"])
        
        def output_schema():
            return {
                HTTPStatus.OK: DogFields().all(),
            }
        ```
        
        `specialize` allows picking and choosing props, while `all` will use every prop defined by the Field. 
        
        `specialize` means any Field object can be customized to it's application, by overriding fields on specific props, 
        only using some fields, and/or excluding other fields.
        
        ```python
        from pet_shop.model import DogFields
        
        def input_schema():
            return DogFields().specialize(overrides={
                "breed": {
                    "required": False,
                },
            }, exclude=["name"])
        ```
        
        Thus, it is possible to capture objects coming in and out of the API, while tailoring them to specific use cases.
        
        ### Flask Wrappers
        
        Flask Wrappers are how the modules that define API endpoints are integrated with Flask. 
        
        ```python
        from dos.flask_wrappers import wrap_validation, wrap_handler, wrap_route
        from flask import Flask
        
        from pet_shop.api.dog import get as dog_get
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        handler_mapping = [
            (dog_get, "/dog/get", "get"),
        ]
        
        for module, path, http_method in handler_mapping:
            handler = wrap_handler(module.__name__, module.handler)
            handler = wrap_validation(handler, module)
            wrap_route(app, handler, path, http_method)
        ```
        
        The handler_mapping is a list of every endpoint that needs to be documented and implemented with dos. The module,
        paired with a string representation of its path and the HTTP method it supports, is then processed with flask wrappers.
        
        `wrap_handler` takes the module and extracts the handler. `wrap_validation` parses the input_schema and the output_schema
        and adds validation to the handler to enforce their constraints. Finally, `wrap_route` adds the endpoint to the flask app 
        itself. 
        
        
        ### Open API 
        
        In same place you create your Flask app, it is easy to also create Open API documentation for that app. 
        
        ```python
        from dos.open_api import OpenAPI
        from flask import Flask
        
        def create_app():
            app = Flask(__name__)
            open_api = OpenAPI("Your API Name", "1.0")
        ```
        
        You can customize the Open API with contact information, a logo, and tags.
        
        ```python
        from dos.open_api import OpenAPI
        
        open_api = OpenAPI("Your API Name", "1.0")
        open_api.add_contact("Pet Shop Dev Team", "https://www.example.com", "pet_shop@example.com")
        open_api.add_logo("/static/pet_shop.png", "#7D9FC3", "Pet Shop", "/")
        open_api.add_tag(
            "introduction",
            "Welcome! This is the documentation for the API.",
        )
        ```
        
        Tags are important for organizing endpoints. If you have a `dog/create` and a `/dog/delete` endpoint, create a 
        dog tag to group them together.
        
        ```python
        from dos.open_api import OpenAPI
        
        open_api = OpenAPI("Your API Name", "1.0")
        open_api.add_tag(
            "dog",
            "Endpoints for interacting with dogs.",
        )
        ```
        
        If you want to add text to the top of the Open API JSON, so others know how it was made, use the 
        disclaimer functionality.
        
        
        ```python
        from dos.open_api import OpenAPI
        
        open_api = OpenAPI("Your API Name", "1.0")
        open_api.add_disclaimer(
            "This file is generated automatically. Do not edit it directly! Edit "
            "the input_schema and output_schema of the endpoint you are changing."
        )
        ```
        
        Finally, to take the `input_schema` and `output_schema` defined in each endpoint module and make Open API out of it,
        call document. 
        
        ```python
