        ### FAQs
        Will I get baned using this bot?
        
        > Botting does violate ESO's terms of service, so technically you could get banned. But this bot doesn't read or write memory from ESO so they won't know you are using a bot. **This software doesn't come with any Liability or Warranty, I am not responsible if you do get banned.**
        
        How much automation does this bot provide?
        
        > It's not a fully automated bot, it does fishing on its own but you will have to move from one hole to another manually (although I was developing a fully automated bot, I didn't get a positive feedback from the community so I discontinued it).
        
        Bot doesn't work in full screen.
        
        > Check the full screen box.
        
        The bot catches the fish but doesn't press R to collect it
        
        > Check the Collect R checkbox
