        ipyhealth is a Pythoon3 library to parse, wrangle and plot `Apple Health data <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/>`_ from all Apple devices.
        
        ipyhealth makes it easy for developers to obtain the Apple Health data, saved as four `pandas` dataframe:
        
        1. `Samples <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/samples>`_: data that is recorded at a specific time, including HKQuantitySample (height, heart rate, energy consumed, etc.), HKCategorySample (user in bed, asleep, or awake) and HKCorrelation (food and blood pressure).
        
        2. `Workouts <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/workouts_and_activity_rings>`_: dataframe containing type (Walk, Run, Hike, Yoga, etc.), duration, energy burned and distance of a recorded workout.
        
        3. `Activity Summary <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkactivitysummary>`_: dataframe containing the move, exercise and stand data for a given day.
        
        4. `Routes <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/workouts_and_activity_rings/reading_route_data>`_: dataframe containing the location of the route file (.gpx file exported), the latitude, lonitude and elevation at different points of the route.

        Usage
        ------
        .. code-block:: python
        
          from ipyhealth.parser import AppleHealthParser
        
          health_data = AppleHealthParser('/location/to/apple_health_export')
        
          type(health_data.records) # pd.DataFrame
          type(health_data.workouts) # pd.DataFrame
          type(health_data.activities) #pd.DataFrame
          type(health_data.routes) #pd.DataFrame
        
        
        To export Apple Health data
        ----------------------------
        
        Download and extract the Apple Health data to a desired location:
        
        1. On your iPhone, open Health App.
        2. Click on your avatar > Scroll to the bottom > Export all health data.
        3. Select Save to Files (save at a location where you can read it).
        4. Unzip the export.zip folder, which contains `apple_health_export` folder:
        
        | apple_health_export
        | ├── export.xml (the main file that is parsed)
        | ├── export_cda.xml (the `Clinical Document Architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Document_Architecture>`_ file is not used)
        | ├── **workout_routes**
        |    ├── route_{timestamp}.gpx (the GPS data for the associated workout)
        |    ├──route_{timestamp}.gpx (these contain the location information)
