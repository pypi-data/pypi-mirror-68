Description: # Don't Forget the Python
        
        Don't Forget the Python is a command-line interface for [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com), an online task-management system.
        
        Remember the Milk is very good at what it does - and is very easy to use in the browser and various apps - so Don't Forget the Python does not focus on duplicating its abilities, but instead adds a couple features that RTM doesn't currently provide, like exporting your tasks to pdf and printing your lists and tasks to the terminal. Currently, only a simplified version of tasks is supported (name and due or completed date).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/): `pipx install dftp`
        
        ## Usage
        
        From a terminal, run `dftp` and the list of available commands will be shown, including full help documentation.
        
        ## New in Version 0.2.0
        
        You can now filter tasks by various due and/or completed dates - on, before, or after a date (and between two dates). Run `dftp tasks --help` in a terminal to see the options.
        
        ## Disclaimer
        
        This CLI uses the Remember The Milk API but is not endorsed or certified by Remember The Milk.
