Description: # relvalconsumer
        
        `relvalconsumer` is a fedora-messaging consumer for creating Fedora release
        validation test events. Each time a compose appears, it runs various checks
        to decide whether it should create an event for the compose. It creates events
        for both nightly composes and 'candidate' composes.
        
        It should create a first nightly for the next release shortly after a release
        goes out. From then until the release, it will create new nightly events
        periodically. It will never create a nightly event fewer than three days after
        the current event. Between three and fourteen days after the current event,
        it will create a new event if certain packages have changed (these are defined
        in the code). After fourteen days it will create an event as soon as a nightly
        compose appears. It will create events for all candidate composes as soon as
        they appear.
        
        It should never create an event for a given release from a Rawhide compose
        after that release branches, because at that point wikitcms will decide that
        any notional event for a Rawhide compose would be for the release *two* after
        the current stable release, and this script will create events only for the
        release *one* after the current stable release.
        
        Note that in production mode the consumer is configured to create events in
        the production wiki and send announcement emails to the test@ mailing list.
        So, really, only one person should ever have it running in production mode,
        and that's probably me. Please don't run it in production mode unless you're
        taking over my job or something.
        
        As long as relval is also installed, relvalconsumer will also run the image
        size check on the newly-created event, whenever it creates an event.
        
        The project also includes another consumer, RelvalAMIConsumer, which updates
        a wiki page containing information on available EC2 AMIs for a validation
        event whenever a relevant 'AMI published' message is received from fedimg
        (the tool that publishes Fedora AMI images to EC2).
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Python libraries:
        
        * [fedora-messaging](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging)
        * [fedfind](https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/fedfind)
        * [wikitcms](https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/python-wikitcms)
        * [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient)
        
        The `hawkey` library is also required. This is only available on Fedora and
        RHEL and is only available from official package repositories, it is not
        available from Pypi.
        
        Optionally also [relval](https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/relval) itself, to run
        image size check tests on the created events.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the required external Python libraries, then use setuptools to
        install, e.g.:
        
                python3 setup.py install
        
        You will also typically need to do:
        
                dnf install fedora-messaging python3-hawkey
        
        ## Configuration
        
        A sample configuration file which is set up to listen for real compose events
        on the production fedora-messaging bus is provided as `relvalconsumer.toml`.
        A sample file for the AMI consumer is provided as `relvalamiconsumer.toml`.
        To use these, you must at least change the queue name from
        `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` to a unique and private string; the
        official recommendation is to use a UUID generated by uuidgen. Then place the
        file in `/etc/fedora-messaging`.
        
        You can then enable and start the consumer as a systemd service:
        
            sudo systemctl enable fm-consumer@relvalconsumer
            sudo systemctl start fm-consumer@relvalconsumer
        
        For the AMI consumer:
        
            sudo systemctl enable fm-consumer@relvalamiconsumer
            sudo systemctl start fm-consumer@relvalamiconsumer
        
        ## Test and production modes
        
        A configuration setting, `relval_prod`, decides whether the consumer operates
        in 'production' or 'test' mode. This is set in the consumer configuration
        file's `consumer_config` section. The corresponding setting for the AMI
        consumer is `relvalami_prod`. In test mode:
        
        * The consumer creates events on the staging wiki (not production wiki)
        * The announcement email is logged rather than being mailed out
        
        In this mode it is fairly safe to play around with the consumer. You will need
        a local fedora-messaging broker instance to be able to trigger the consumer at
        will, though. Depending on how you set that up, you may also need to change
        the `routing_keys` from `.prod.` to `.dev.` or similar.
        
        For 'production':
        
        * **The consumer creates events on the production wiki**
        * **The consumer sends email notifications to public mailing lists**
        
        **PLEASE** do not enable the production consumer unless you're absolutely sure
        it's your job to create the official events.
