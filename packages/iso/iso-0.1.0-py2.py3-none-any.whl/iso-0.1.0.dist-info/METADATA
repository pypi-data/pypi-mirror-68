========
iso
========

iso is a python package aimed at simplifying the development and deployment cycle associated with building machine-learning models. It enables much more mental clarity during the process of designing a learning algorithm by allowing developers to easily compartmentalize the problem theyâ€™re working on.

Features:
    * Ability to define modular data transformations that become a part of your model. This helps developers stay organized during the model building process, and makes transitioning models across developers painless.
    * Tools for transforming both predictors AND responses in a single step.
    * Tools for easily doing data augmentation.
    * Ability to easily save and deploy models.
    * Allows for more intuitive interaction with model building process.

Comprehensive documentation is currently lacking, but will be included in the next release.
