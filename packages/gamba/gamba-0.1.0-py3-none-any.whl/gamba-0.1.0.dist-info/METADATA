# gamba: gambling transaction analysis in Python


gamba is an open source transaction analysis library written in Python. It contains a collection of methods for reproducing work in the field of player behaviour tracking - a subset of gambling studies focussed on understanding behaviours for consumer protection.


## Where to get it
The source code is available at www.github.com/gamba-dev/gamba

It can be installed through PyPi
`pip install gamba`

## Documentation
The documentation for gamba is available at [gamba.dev](https://www.gamba.dev)

## License
gamba is [BSD-3 licensed](https://www.github.com/gamba-dev/gamba/license.md).

## Background
gamba was created by [Oliver J. Scholten](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tvAteogAAAAJ&hl=en) as a way to transparently replicate existing work in the field of player behaviour tracking. By open sourcing the tools needed to perform existing analyses, we hope to help researchers and regulators keep pace with understanding new gambling technologies and their social and economic impacts.
