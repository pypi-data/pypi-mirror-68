**DEVELOPMENT BRANCH**: The current branch is a development version. Go to the stable release by clicking
on `the master branch <https://github.com/Nekmo/gkeep/tree/master>`_.


Google Keep Cli
###############
Work with Google Keep on your terminal. To install this module::

    pip install gkeep

Create a file with your Google credentials called ``auth.txt`` in the current directory::

    <username> <password>

For example::

    nekmo mypassword1234

You can also use the ``--auth`` parameter to set the path to the file with the credentials::

    gkeep --auth /path/to/auth.txt


Notes
=====
It is possible to create, delete, update and view the notes in Google keep. The common parameters are:

* ``title``: Title to add to the note.
* ``text``: Note message body.
* ``color``: color used in the note.
* ``labels``: tags added to notes.


Add note
--------
It is possible to add a new note to Google Keep:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep add-note[ --color <color>][--labels <labels>] <title> <text>

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep add-note "Today's tasks" "Install gkeep cli and configure it"


Edit note
---------
It is possible to edit an existing note. The following parameters are available to choose the note to edit
(in this command all filters have the prefix ``filter-``):

* ``--filter-id``: id of the note. This is the preferred way to ensure editing the correct note.
* ``--filter-title``: note title. Warning: The titles of the notes are not unique.
* ``--filter-query``: search in titles and body of the notes. This is the least accurate filter.

The syntax is:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep edit-note <filter>[ --color <color>][--labels <labels>][ --title <title>][ --text <text>]

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep edit-note --filter-title "Today's tasks" --text "GKeep installed, continue reading the docs"


Search notes
------------
The ``search-notes`` command allows you to search for notes and add filters. In addition to the ``--color``,
``--labels``, ``--title`` and ``--text`` filters the following filters are available:

* ``--deleted`` / ``--not-deleted``: the note is deleted or not.
* ``--trashed`` / ``--not-trashed``: the note is trashed or not.
* ``--pinned`` / ``--not-pinned``: the note is pinned or not.
* ``--archived`` / ``--not-archived``: the note is archived or not.

The syntax is:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep search-notes[ <filters>][ <query>]

For example (the text "GKeep installed" is a search term):

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep search-notes --not-deleted "GKeep installed"


Get note
---------
Get a note by its id or by its title or text. If the id is unknown, you can use the ``--title`` and/or
``--text`` filters:


The syntax is:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep get-note[ <filters>][ <id>]

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep get-note 161d1ad8c82.b2ed17d26167c9bc


Delete note
-----------
It works just like get-note. Delete a note by its id or by its title or text. If the id is unknown,
you can use the ``--title`` and/or ``--text`` filters:

The syntax is:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep delete-note[ <filters>][ <id>]

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep delete-note 161d1ad8c82.b2ed17d26167c9bc


Items
=====
Notes can have multiple items with checkboxes. The common parameters for the items are:

* ``<note id>``: note identificator. For example, ``75e4202b0c1.9fc0b868a7b34952``. You can obtain the identifier
  using the web version of Google Keep. Click on the note and look at the url. Example: ``https://keep.google
  .com/#NOTE/75e4202b0c1.9fc0b868a7b34952.``
* ``<item name>``: value of the element. For exemple, ``Milk``.
* ``--check/--uncheck``: Item is checked or not.


Add item on note
----------------
This command allows you to add items to an existing note. By default if the element already exists,
it is not duplicated. If you want duplicate the element, use the ``--duplicate`` parameter. If the element
does not exist, by default it is unchecked.

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep add-item <note id> "<item name>"[ --check/--uncheck][ --duplicate/no-duplicate]

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep add-item 75e4202b0c1.9fc0b868a7b34952 "Chip cookies" --check


Edit item on note
-----------------
Modify an existing entry. It allows to change if it is checked and the text.

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep edit-item <note id> "<item name>"[ --check/--uncheck][ --new-text <new text>]

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep edit-item 75e4202b0c1.9fc0b868a7b34952 "Chip cookies" --uncheck

.. code-block:: bash

    gkeep edit-item 75e4202b0c1.9fc0b868a7b34952 "Chip cookies"
                      --new-text "Chocolate orange cookies"
