Description: # py4linear-regression
        
        Linear Regression Python Library
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        This project is simply implementation of linear regression algorithm in python programming language.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Numpy
        
        
        ### Installing
        
        The easiest way to install py4linear-regression is using pip
        
        ```
        pip install py4linear-regression
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        There is 2 public method of Linear Regression class. It is learn and predict method, learn method takes 5 argument namely x_train, t_train, alpha, and epoch. It is the training data, it's label, learning rate, and number of iteration respectively. predict method takes 1 argument namely x_test. It is the data to be predicted
        ```
        from py4linear_regression.regression import linear_regression
        x_train = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]
        t_train = [0,1,2,3]
        classifier = linear_regression()
        classifier.learn(x_train,t_train,0.01,250)
        x_test = [[0.01,0.99],[0.99,0.01]]
        y = classifier.predict(x_test)
        ```
