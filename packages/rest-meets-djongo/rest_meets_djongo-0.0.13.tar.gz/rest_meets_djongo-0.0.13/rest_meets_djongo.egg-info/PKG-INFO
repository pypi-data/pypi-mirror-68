Description: rest-meets-djongo
        ===
        This package enables default model serializers for models with Djongo 
        fields to be generated, for use in Django-Rest-Framework apps
        
        ## Features
        **NOTE: This repo is currently under active development, and many of the
        features of the package may act in strange ways. Please report any issues 
        to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/SomeoneInParticular/rest_meets_djongo/issues) 
        or [GitHub](https://github.com/SomeoneInParticular/rest_meets_djongo/issues) 
        as you find them**
        
        Similar to DRF ModelSerializers, creating serializers using 
        DjongoModelSerializer allows for the following fields to be detected and 
        automatically managed through DRF's serializer setup. These fields 
        include:
        * ObjectIDField
        * EmbeddedField
        * ArrayField
        
        The following are currently not fully functional, and as a result are 
        not explicitly supported (yet):
        * ForeignKeyField (Reverse relations are not generated, even if specified, 
        by Djongo)
        * ManyToManyField (Reverse relations are not generated, even if specified, 
        by Djongo)
        * ArrayReferenceField (WIP)
