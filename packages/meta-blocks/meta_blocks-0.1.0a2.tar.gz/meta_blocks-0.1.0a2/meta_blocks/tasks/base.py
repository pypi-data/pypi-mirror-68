class Task(abc.ABC):

    Tasks wrap around datasets and must implement an interface for data access.
    Currently, tasks are designed to only support few-shot classification.
    Support for other types of tasks (imitation, RL, etc.) is planned.

    Each task must provide access to a balanced query set with `num_query_shots`
    points per class. The support set can be arbitrary, and it is up to the
    subclass to determine how its support set is defined and constructed.

    Base abstract class for task distributions.

    Task distributions wrap around meta-datasets and must implement an interface
    for selecting/sampling (batches of) tasks (and the corresponding datasets)
    used for meta-training or evaluation.

    Notes
    -----
    * Task distributions are currently implemented with graph execution mode in
      mind, i.e., they build static graphs for `meta_dataset.batch_size` tasks.
      The data provided by each task depends on some internal placeholders, e.g.
      the ids of the categories the data is pulled from for each class and ids
      of the instances used to construct support and query sets. After building
      a task distribution, we get access to a symbolic `task_batch` upon which
      we can further build other parts of the graph (adaptation, models, etc.).

    * At meta-training time, at each step, we can call `sample_task_feed` which
      returns feed values for all necessary placeholders that must be provided
      to the `tf.Session.run` method.
