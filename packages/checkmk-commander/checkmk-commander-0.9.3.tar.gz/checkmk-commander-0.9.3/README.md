Check Commander
===============

Checkmk Commander, or Check Commander, efficient Curses interface for Checkmk, <https://checkmk.com/>.

![Logo](https://gitlab.com/larsfp/checkmk-commander/-/raw/master/images/logo_256.png)

The goal is not to completely avoid the web interface, but to speed up common day-to-day tasks. Actions like acknowledge, downtime, reinventorize can be done in seconds, with keyboard only. Overview is clean and simple.

Beta quality. Can be used. Report bugs! Some features may behave weirdly, but won't eat your data.
