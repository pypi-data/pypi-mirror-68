It automatically embeds thumbnails to mp3/mp4/m4a files.\n\nvidl will add metadata to mp3 files if it\'s found. The `--no-md` option turns this off.\n`title`, `artist` and `year` metadata is added, but if the URL is a playlist, it also adds `album`, `album artist`, `track number`, `track count`.\nIf the title contains " - ", vidl often uses what comes before and after it as artist and title respectively. The `--dont-extract-md` option turns off this behaviour.\n\n# Installation\n1. Install Python (3.7 is recommended)\n2. Install [ffmpeg and ffprobe](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)\n3. Run `pip3 install vidl`.\n4. If you\'re not on macOS or Windows, you need to specify where vidl will download files to in your vidl config file. Run `vidl --config-path` to see where the config file is.\nIf you\'re on macOS, I recommend [setting up shortcuts for vidl](#macos-shortcut-setup)\n\n# Updating\nvidl is updated by running `pip3 install vidl --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager`.\nIf vidl is unable to download a URL, it might be because youtube-dl is outdated. The `--upgrade-strategy eager` part updates youtube-dl.\n\n# Uninstall\nRun `pip3 uninstall vidl`.\n\nTo fully uninstall vidl, go to vidl\'s config file (Run `vidl --config-path` to see where it is) and delete the folder it\'s in.\n\n# Usage\nExamples:\n`vidl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta_ZVS7HkwI`\n- Downloads the video as mp3, and adds metadata it detects.\n\n`vidl mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta_ZVS7HkwI --no-md`\n- Downloads the video as mp3, without adding metadata.\n\n`vidl`\n- Prints vidl\'s help menu, which looks like this:\n    ```\n    Download Usage:\n        vidl [format] [options] <URL>\n\n    Download Options:\n        format             mp3, mp4, wav or m4a. Default mp3.\n        --no-md            Don\'t add metadata to downloaded files.\n        --no-smart-md      Don\'t extract artist and song name from title.\n        --no-dl            Don\'t download anything. Usually used with -v\n        -v, --verbose      Display all logs.\n\n    General Options:\n        --version          Show version. vidl -v and vidl version works too.\n        -h, --help         Show this help message. vidl help works too.\n        --config-path      Show the location of the configuration file.\n\n    Update:\n        pip install vidl --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager\n    ```\n\n# Configuration\nvidl has a configuration file, which you can find the location of by running `vidl --config-path`. In it, you can set the download folder and filename template.\n\nIf you screw something up, you can delete the file, and the default will be recreated the next time you run vidl.\n\n# Custom metadata parsing\n\nvidl has a `user_md_parser.py` file. By default, it does nothing, but you can configure it to manipulate metadata of songs you download however you like. In my case, I set the "Comment" metadata to "NCS" if the title ends with "[NCS Release]".\n\nDocumentation for this can be found in the file itself. The file is in the same folder as vidl\'s config file, which you can find by by running `vidl --config-path`. If you screw something up, you can delete the file, and the default will be recreated the next time you run vidl.\n\n# <a name="macos-shortcut-setup"></a>Set up shortcuts for vidl (macOS)\nYou\'ll be able to select any piece of text, press your chosen shortcut and the link(s) in your selected text will be downloaded! A little tedious to set up, but well worth it.\n\nFirst, we need to create a macOS Service:\n1. Open the Automator app.\n2. Choose File > New, and select Service.\n3. (TLDR; Add `Run Shell Script`) In the window that just popped up, there are two columns on the left (if not, click the `Library` button in the status bar). Select `Utilities` in the first column, and in the second column, drag `Run Shell Script` into the main part of the window.\n4. Make your settings match these:\n    \n    ![Service receives selected [URLs] in [any application]. Input is [only URLs]. In your Run Shell Script box; Shell: [/bin/bash]. Pass input: [as arguments]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpectralKH/vidl/master/macos-service-screenshot.png)\n    \n    If you want the shortcut to only work in one app, select that app instead of `any application`.\n5. In the text box in the "Run Shell Script" box, paste in the following script:\n    ```bash\n    for f in "$@"\n    do\n      # behave like a normal terminal window:\n      export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n      source ~/.bash_profile\n\n      vidl "$f"\n    done\n    ```\n6. Choose File > Save. Type in vidl.\n\nAlmost done, you just need to tie a shortcut to the macOS Service you just created:\n1. Open the System Preferences app.\n2. Go to Keyboard and select the Shortcuts tab.\n3. Select Services from the left column, and locate vidl (should be under Internet). Add your preferred shortcut.\n\n# Dev Instructions\n\n### Installation\n1. Install Python. You may want to install it using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) in order to manage Python versions (If Poetry doesn\'t detect the right version, you can fix it with pyenv).\n2. Install [ffmpeg and ffprobe](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)\n3. Install [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io)\n4. Run `poetry install` to install Python package dependencies.\n5. If you\'re not on macOS or Windows, you need to specify where vidl will download files to in your vidl config file. Run `vidl --config-path` to see where the config file is.\n\nI recommend running `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`. This command makes Poetry create your Python virtual environment inside the project folder, so you\'ll be able to easily delete it. Additionally, it lets VSCode\'s Python extension detect the virtual environment if you set the `python.pythonPath` setting to `${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python` in your workspace (or global) settings.\n\n### Running\n```\npoetry run vidl\n```\n\nAn alternative to `poetry run <command>` is to run `poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment\'s Bash CLI, and then run the command on it\'s own (e.g `vidl`).\n\n\n### Releasing a new version\n\nFirst of all, consider updating the lockfile dependencies by running `poetry update`, then check if things still work.\n\n1. Bump the version number. `<version>` can be `patch`, `minor`, `major` or a version number:\n```\npoetry version <version>\n```\n\n2. Build:\n```\npoetry build\n```\n\n3. Publish to PyPI:\n```\npoetry publish\n```\n',
