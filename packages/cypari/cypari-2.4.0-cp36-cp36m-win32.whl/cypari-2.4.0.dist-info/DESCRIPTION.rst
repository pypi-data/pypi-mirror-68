The package *cypari* is a Python wrapper for the `PARI library
<http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_, a computer algebra system for
number theory computations.  It is derived from the `corresponding
component
<https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/797dd7b4c273556d9677fadffa2ef6dd7f113857/src/sage/libs/cypari2/gen.pyx>`_
of `SageMath <http://www.sagemath.org>`_, but is independent of the rest of
SageMath and can be used with any recent version of Python 2 or 3.
