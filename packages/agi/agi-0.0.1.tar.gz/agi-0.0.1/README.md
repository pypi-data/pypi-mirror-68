# AGI

Apparently AGI will be the biggest breakthrough in like forever.

Suppose it is true that AGI can be used to solve everything. Then GDP will tend towards infinity if AGI is achieved. AGI will probably be written in Python because network effects and lock-in (sorry Julia and Swift). Therefore the PyPi namespace for AGI will be infinitely valuable.

If you wish to acquire this namespace, please send me infinite $$$ (bitcoin not accepted), and we'll see what we can do! 

Cheers.
