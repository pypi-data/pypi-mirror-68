What is it?
=================

Cocoapi for python >= 3.6 that pip-installs on Windows.

* only works on Windows. 
* only supports Iptc for now. Exif and Xmp are on their  way.
* straight-up exposure of the C++ methods. Feel free to write more pythonic classes on top.

How do I set it up?
-------------------------------

* pip install cocoapi-windows
