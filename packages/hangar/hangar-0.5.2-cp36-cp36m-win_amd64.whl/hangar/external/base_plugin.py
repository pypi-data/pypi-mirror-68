"""
Hangar's external plugin system is designed to make it flexible for users to
write custom plugins for custom data formats. External plugins should be python
installables and should make itself discoverable using package meta data. A
`detailed documentation <https://packaging.python.org/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/#using-package-metadata>`_
can be found in the official python doc. But for a headstart and to avoid going
through this somewhat complex process, we have made a `cookiecutter
<https://github.com/tensorwerk/cookiecutter-hangar-external-plugin>`_ package.
All the hangar plugins follow the naming standard similar to Flask plugins i.e
`hangar_pluginName`

    """Base plugin class from where all the external plugins should be inherited.

    Child classes can have four methods to expose - ``load``, ``save``,
    ``show`` and ``board_show``. These are considered as valid methods and
    should be passed as the first argument while initializing the parent from
    child. Child should also inform the parent about the acceptable file
    formats by passing that as second argument. :class:`.BasePlugin` accepts
    ``provides`` and ``accepts`` on init and exposes them which is then used by
    plugin manager while loading the modules. BasePlugin also provides
    ``sample_name`` function to figure out the sample name from the file path.
    This function is used by ``load`` method to return the sample name which is
    then used by hangar as a key to save the data

        Loads the data provided from the disk for the file path given and
        returns the data as :class:`numpy.ndarray` and name of the data sample.
        Names returned from this function will be used by the import cli system
        as the key for the returned data. This function can return either a
        single :class:`numpy.ndarray`, sample name, combination, or a generator
        that produces one of the the above combinations. This helps when the
        input file is not a single data entry like an image but has multiple
        data points like CSV files.

        An example implementation that returns a single data point:

                data = create_np_array('myimg.jpg')
                name = create_sample_name('myimg.jpg')  # could use `self.sample_name`
                return data, name

        An example implementation that returns a generator could look like this:

        .. code-block:: python

            def load(self, fpath, *args, **kwargs):

        If the plugin is developed for files like CSV, JSON, etc - where
        multiple data entry would go to the same file - this should check
        whether the file exist already and weather it should modify / append
        the new data entry to the structure, instead of overwriting it or
        throwing an exception.

        Note
        ----
        Name of the file and the whole path to save the data should be constructed
        by this function. This can be done using the information gets as arguments
        such as, ``outdir``, ``sample_detail`` and ``extension``. It has been
        offloaded to this function instead of handling it before because, decisions
        like whether the multiple data entry should go to a single file or mutltpile
        file cannot be predicted before hand as are always data specific (and hence
        plugin specific)

        Note
        ----
        If the call to this function is initiated by the CLI, ``sample_detail`` argument
        will be a string formatted as `sample_name_type:sample_name`. For example, if
        the sample name is `sample1` (and type of sample name is `str`) then
        ``sample_detail`` will be `str:sample1`. This is to avoid the ambiguity that
        could arise by having both integer and string form of numerical as the sample
        name (ex: if column[123] and column["123"] exist). Formatting
        ``sample_detail`` to make a proper filename (not necessary) is upto the
        plugin developer.
