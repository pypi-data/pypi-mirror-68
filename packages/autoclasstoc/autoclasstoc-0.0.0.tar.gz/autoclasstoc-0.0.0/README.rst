************
``autoclasstoc`` is a Sphinx extension that makes it easier to navigate the 
documentation for large classes.  More specifically, it provides a directive 
that can be used to make a succinct table of contents (TOC) for any python 
class.  The TOC will include a link to the full documentation for each method 
in the class.  Inherited methods are organized by parent class, and are 
collapsed to save space (similar to doxygen).
