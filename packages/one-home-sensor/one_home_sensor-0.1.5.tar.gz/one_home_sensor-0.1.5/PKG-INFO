        # One Home Sensor
        
        This peace of software reads temperature, pressure and humidity from a BME280 sensor. It then pushes the result to a MongoDB data-base (MongoDB Atlas form my part). 
        
        ## Usage 
        My setup is as followed :
        ```
          +-------------+
          | RaspberryPI |    +-------------+    +-------------+ 
          |             |    |  MongoDB    |    |  Phone /    |
          |  one_home_  +--->|  Atlas      +--->|  WebBrowser |
          |     sensor  |    +-------------+    +-------------+
          +-------------+
        ```
        I periodically run it (throught systemd) to store the values. 
        
        
        ## Integration / Instalation
        This programe is created and only used/tested/supported in python3. These commande should solve all dificulties. 
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pip i2c-tools 
        ```
        1. Create cluster on MongoDB Atlas
        2. Create connection autorization and user 
        3. Create configuration file (see next section)
        4. Enable  I2C in raspi-config (5 then P5).
        5. Add user to group "i2c" (sudo usermod -a -G i2c leadthesalt)
        
        Finaly the module is installed with pip3.
        ```
        pip3 install one-home-sensor
        ```
        
        For my part I install the programe with an Ansible rôle. Sure I could create a debian package, but I only use it on my Raspbery Pi that are already managed throught Ansible. 
         
        ## Configuration file 
        ```
        [MongoDBAtlasConnection]
        username = # username set for MongoDB
        password = # password set for MongoDB
        clusterfqdn = # fqdn to MongoDB server 
        
        [Correction]
        temp=-1
        ```
