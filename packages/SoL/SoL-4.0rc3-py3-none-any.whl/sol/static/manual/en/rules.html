<li><p>If in a proper/improper stroke a player pockets his Striker
alone, his turn shall be lost and one of his C/m will be taken
out as penalty by his opponent for placing. Such penalty C/m
shall be called &quot;Due&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>If this happens before any of his C/m is pocketed the penalty
Due shall remain outstanding and shall be taken out as soon as
it is available.</p></li>

<li><ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>In Doubles the Due and/or penalty C/m shall always be taken out
for placing by the player who is sitting on the right hand side
of the player having his turn at the time of the availabilityof
C/m.</p></li>
<li><p>If, however, during the turn of a player, he pockets the C/m
of the opponent with or without his C/m and the Due and/or

sufficient space is not available, the player who has to place
the C/m shall be permitted to do so immediately after space
becomes available.</p></li>

penalty C/m has passed on to the partner, the partner alone
shall have the right to take out and place the C/m.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If space is available for placing the Due and/or penalty C/m, but
the player who has to place the C/m does not desire to risk a foul,
he shall lose his chance to place and his claim for placing shall
stand forfeited.</p></li>
<li><p>If the space becomes available for placing the Due and/or penalty
C/m during the turn of the player eligible to place, the placing
shall be made immediately.</p></li>
<li><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>While placing the Due and/or penalty C/m, if a player places his
own C/m by mistake, it has to be rectified, if pointed out by
the Umpire or the opponent. A foul shall be declared as per the

the C/m have to be placed as soon as available.</p></li>
<li><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Placing shall be considered as complete once the finger is
removed from the C/m provided the C/m placed is inside the Outer
Circle.</p></li>
<li><p>However, while placing Due/penalty C/m, holding of any other C/m
and/or Striker is not permitted.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If a player places or moves the Due and/or penalty C/m away from
the Outer Circle, he shall be asked to place the C/m inside the
Outer Circle. A foul shall be declared as per the Laws.</p></li>
<li><p>While placing the Due and/or penalty C/m the player should not
move any other C/m and/or Queen. The C/m so placed shall not
disturb any other C/m and/or Queen. The C/m so placed shall not
disturb and other C/m. If it so happens, the same shall be
replaced by the Umpire in the original position, as far as
possible. A foul shall be declared against the offending player as
per the Laws.</p></li>
<li><p>A player may choose to forego the Dua and/or penalty C/m in toto
only and not partially. Such decision shall be communicated to the
Umpire within 15 seconds, failing which the right to place the Due
and/or penalty shall be forfeited.</p></li>
<li><p>The time limit for placing Due and/or penalty C/m shall be 15
seconds after the announcement made by the Umpire.</p></li>
<li><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Due and/or penalty C/m cannot be set off against each other.</p></li>

Circle wholly or partially. If placed, the player shall be asked
to rectify. A foul shall be declared against the offending
player as per the Laws.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>In Doubles, a player shall not take out the penalty and/or Due C/m
for his partner, who has to place it. In case his partner does not
find the required C/m in the pockets adjoining his side, he shall
request the Umpire to provide, specifying the colour and number he
needs for placing.</p></li>
<li><p>During the course of the board, if a player gets up from the seat
during his or his opponent's turn, for any reason, he shall lose
the board with the number of his C/m and/or Queen lying on the
