 Printouts
===========

.. hint:: Since version 3.33 almost all printouts show a QRCode__ on the first page containing
          an hyperlink to the corresponding `Lit Page`. The QRCode can be either recognized
          with one of the many freely available app on a smartphone, or simply clicked when
          viewing the PDF on a traditional computer.

          The QRCode **does not appear** when you use the ``localhost`` address to access your
          local instance of SoL, though. If you want it, you must use the IP address of your
          machine instead: instead of using the URL ``http://localhost:6996/`` to access SoL,
          use something like ``http://192.168.1.123:6996/`` (of course you must determine and
          use the IP address of the computer where SoL is running) and the QRCode should appear
          and be usable by other devices connected to your local LAN.
