.. _users management:

Users management
----------------

To interact with the system, that is to be able to insert new tournaments and other entities,
one must inserts his *credentials* into the :ref:`login panel <authentication>`. Such
credentials may be either granted by the *administrator*, or by a :ref:`self registration
<signin>`.

A user may create new *entities* such as :ref:`clubs <clubs management>`, :ref:`championships
<championships management>`, :ref:`players <players management>` and :ref:`tourneys <tourneys
management>`, that are automatically *assigned* to him (in other words, he becomes the
*owner*): while the *administrator* may modify everything in the system, all other users may
change or delete *only* the entities belonging to them.

:guilabel:`Clubs`
  Opens the :ref:`management of the clubs <clubs management>` which the selected user is
  responsible of

:guilabel:`Championships`
  Opens the :ref:`management of the championships <championships management>` which the

.. _users insert and edit:

Insert and edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index::
   pair: Insert and edit; Users

All fields, with the exception of :guilabel:`language`, are mandatory.

Email and password
++++++++++++++++++

These are the *credentials* the user shall insert into the :ref:`login panel <authentication>`.
The :guilabel:`email` must be a valid address and the :guilabel:`password` may be anything
longer than five characters.

.. note:: While the :ref:`self registration <signin>` procedure ascertains the validity of the
          email address, when it is inserted or modified manually no check is done that the
          address corresponds to an existing mailbox. It is therefore recommended to pay
          particular attention: a wrong value precludes the possibility of :ref:`resetting
          <reset-password>` the password should it be forgotten!

First name and last name
++++++++++++++++++++++++

These fields cannot be left empty.

Language
++++++++

If set, this overrides the browser's default when the user logs in.

.. _owners admin:

Owners admin
++++++++++++

The *administrator* can grant a :guilabel:`owners admin` permission to particular users: when a
user has this right he can change the ownership of other items (clubs, tournaments...), even of
those not belonging to him.

.. _players manager:

Players manager
+++++++++++++++

The *administrator* can grant a :guilabel:`players manager` permission to particular users:
when a user has this right he can insert new players, or modify and delete existing ones.

.. note:: Allow anyone to manage the list of players, as was the case with versions of SoL
          prior to 4, has caused numerous problems, primarily the presence of :ref:`duplicates
          <duplicates>`: a bit for laziness, a bit for linguistic difficulties, is clearly more
          hasty to reinsert a player who shows up at a tournament than to check if it is
          already present in the database.

          Resolving these cases is not always easy when you do not know them in person.

          With version 4 it was decided to be able to give the possibility to manage the
          players only to a clearly defined group of users: in principle there will be a set of
          recognized responsible, reasonably one for each country, leaving the insert and edit
          of individual players to those who know them and can to identify them.

.. _users status:

Status
++++++

The current status of the user:

`Registered`
  the `self registration <signin>` procedure has not been completed yet: users in this state
  **cannot** log in

`Confirmed`
  this is the normal state for an operational user
