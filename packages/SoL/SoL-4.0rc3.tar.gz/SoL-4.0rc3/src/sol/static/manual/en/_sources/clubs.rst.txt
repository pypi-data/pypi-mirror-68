Clubs management
----------------

.. index::
   pair: Management; Clubs

A *club* is the entity that organizes one or more *championships* of *tourneys*. It can also
have a list of associated *players*.

.. index:: National federations

A club may also be a *national federation*, which usually coordinates the clubs of a particular
country. Often the international tourneys are hosted by this or that federation in turn and
usually it is mandatory for a player to be affiliated with a particular federation before she
can participate to an event.

Description
+++++++++++

Each club has a :guilabel:`description`, that must be unique: there cannot be two distinct
clubs with the same description.

Nationality, web site and email
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The :guilabel:`nationality`, the :guilabel:`web site URL` and the :guilabel:`email` are
optional. The latter may be used to send email messages to the responsible for the club.

Rating
++++++

The :guilabel:`rating` is used as the default value when creating new championships of this
club: usually, but not always, all championships of a particular club use the same rating; in
any case, it's the :ref:`tourney's setting <tourney rating>` to be decisive, because it may
happens that a particular event, even if it belongs to a given championship, uses a different
rating, for example for an *open* tournament.

Federation
++++++++++

A club may be marked as a :guilabel:`federation`: to be accepted at international events it is
often mandatory for a player to be affiliated with a national federation.

Pairing method and bounties
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The :guilabel:`pairing method` and the :guilabel:`prize-giving method` are used as default
values when new championships are added to the club.

Owner
+++++

The user who is *responsible* of the club data, usually the one that inserted that particular
record: the information related to the club are changeable only by him (and also by the
*administrator* of the system).

.. _emblem:

Emblem
++++++

The :guilabel:`emblem` field may contain the name of an image file (either a ``.png``, a
``.gif``, or ``.jpg``) that will printed on the :ref:`badges`. Although it will be scaled as
needed, it's recommended to put there a reasonably sized logo\ [#]_.

.. [#] The application imposes a 512Kb limit, considering the *raw* size of the image: although
       it may depend on the browser, usually it gets converted to the ``PNG`` format, so in
       general it does *not* correspond to the size of the original selected image.
