"""
base class for python applications with a graphical user interface
==================================================================

The abstract base class :class:`MainAppBase` provided by this ae namespace
portion can be used for to integrate any of the available Python GUI
frameworks into the ae namespace.

The plan is to integrate the following GUI frameworks until the begin of 2021:

* :mod:`Kivy <ae.kivy_app>` - see also :ref:`kivy lisz demo app <https://gitlab.com/ae-group/kivy_lisz>`
* :mod:`Enaml <ae.enaml_app>` - see also :ref:`enaml lisz demo app <https://gitlab.com/ae-group/enaml_lisz>`
* :mod:`Beeware <ae.beeware_app>`
* :mod:`QPython <ae.qpython_app>`
* :mod:`pyglet <ae.pyglet_app>`
* :mod:`pygobject <ae.pygobject_app>`
* :mod:`Dabo <ae.dabo_app>`
* :mod:`AppJar <ae.appjar_app>`

Currently available is the :mod:`Kivy <ae.kivy_app>` integration of
the :ref:`Kivy Framework <kivy.org>`.

.. note:
    In implementing the outstanding framework integrations this module will be
    extended and changed frequently.


extended console application environment
----------------------------------------

The abstract base class :class:`MainAppBase` inherits directly from the ae namespace
class :class:`ae console application environment class <ae.console.ConsoleApp>`.
The so inherited helper methods are useful for to log, configure and
control the run-time of your GUI app via command line arguments,
:ref:`config-options` and :ref:`config-files`.

.. hint::
    Please see the documentation of the :mod:`ae.console` namespace
    portion/module for more detailed information.

:class:`MainAppBase` adds on top of the :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp`
the concepts of :ref:`application status` and :ref:`application flow`,
explained further down.


application status
------------------

Any application- and user-specific configurations like e.g. the last
window position/size, the app theme/font or the last selected flow
within your app, could be included in the application status.

This namespace portion introduces the section `aeAppState` in the app
:ref:`config-files`, where any status values can be stored persistently
for to be recovered on the next startup of your application.

.. hint::
    The section name `aeAppState` is declared by the
    :data:`APP_STATE_SECTION_NAME` constant. If you need
    to access this config section directly then please
    use this constant instead of the hardcoded section name.

.. _app-state-variables:

This module is providing/pre-defining the following application state variables:

    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_id`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.font_size`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.light_theme`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.sound_volume`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.win_rectangle`

Which app state variables are finally used by your app project is (fully data-driven)
depending on the app state :ref:`config-variables` detected in all the
:ref:`config-files` that are found/available at run-time of your app.
The names of all the available application state variables can be
determined with the main app helper method :meth:`~MainAppBase.app_state_keys`.

If your application is e.g. supporting a user-defined font size, using the
provided/pre-defined app state variable :attr:`~MainAppBase.font_size`, then
it has to call the method :meth:`change_app_state` with the
:paramref:`~MainAppBase.change_app_state.state_name` set to `font_size`
every time when the user has changed the font size of your app.

.. hint::
    The two built-in app state variables are :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_id` and
    :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path` will be explained detailed in the next section.

The :meth:`~MainBaseApp.load_app_states` method is called on instantiation
from the implemented main app class for to load the values of all
app state variables from the :ref:`config-files`, and is then calling
:meth:~MainAppBase.setup_app_states` for pass them into their corresponding
instance attributes.

Use the main app instance attribute for to read/get the actual value of
a single app state variable. The actual values of
all app state variables as a dict is determining the method
:meth:`~MainBaseApp.retrieve_app_states`.

Changed app state value that need to be propagated also to the framework
app instance should never be set via the instance attribute, instead call
the method :meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_app_state` (which ensures (1) the
propagation to any duplicated (observable/bound) framework property and
(2) the event notification to related the main app instance method).

For to to save the app state to the :ref:`config-files` the
implementing main app instance has to call the method
:meth:`~MainBaseApp.save_app_states` - this could be
done e.g. after the app state has changed or at least
on quiting the application.

.. _app-state-constants:

This module is also providing some pre-defined constants
that can be optionally used in your application in relation
to the app states data store and for the app state config
variables :attr:`~MainAppBase.font_size` and
:attr:`~MainAppBase.light_theme`:

    * :data:`APP_STATE_SECTION_NAME`
    * :data:`APP_STATE_VERSION_VAR_NAME`
    * :data:`APP_STATE_CURRENT_VERSION`
    * :data:`MIN_FONT_SIZE`
    * :data:`MAX_FONT_SIZE`
    * :data:`THEME_LIGHT_BACKGROUND_COLOR`
    * :data:`THEME_LIGHT_FONT_COLOR`
    * :data:`THEME_DARK_BACKGROUND_COLOR`
    * :data:`THEME_DARK_FONT_COLOR`


application flow
----------------

For to control the current state and application/work flow
(or context) of your application, and to persist it until
the next app start, :class:`MainBaseApp` provides
two :ref:`app-state-variables`.
:attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_id` for to store the currently working flow
and :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path` for to store the history of
nested flows.

A application flow is represented by an id string that defines
three things: (1) the action for to enter into the flow, (2)
the data or object that gets currently worked on and (3)
an optional key string that is identifying/indexing
a widget or data item of your application context/flow.

.. note::
    Never concatenate a flow id string manually, use the
    :func:`id_of_flow` function instead.

The flow id is initially an empty string. As soon as the user is
starting a new work flow or the current selection your application
should call the method :meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_flow` passing
the flow id string into the
:paramref:`~MainAppBase.change_flow.flow_id` argument
for to change the app flow.

For more complex applications you can specify a path of nested flows.
This flow path gets represented by the app state variable
:attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path`, which is a list of flow
id strings.

For to enter into a deeper/nested flow you simply call
:meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_flow` with one of the actions
defined in :data:`ACTIONS_EXTENDING_FLOW_PATH`.

For to go back to a previous flow in the flow path
call :meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_flow` passing one of the
actions defined in :data:`ACTIONS_REDUCING_FLOW_PATH`.


application events
------------------

The helper method :meth:`~MainAppBase.call_method` can be used to support
optionally implemented event callback routines.

An implementation for a GUI framework should provide at least the
following application events (which have to be fired exactly
one time in the runtime of the app):

* `on_app_init`: fired after the resources got loaded (normally done by the
  method :meth:`init_app` which gets implemented by the inheriting app class layer)
  and before the GUI framework app class instance gets initialized.
* `on_app_start`: fired after the framework app and window classes got initialized
  and the first window will be displayed (mostly by calling the `show` method
  of the window, but this is depending on the finally used GUI framework)
  and before the event loop of the used GUI framework got started.
* `on_app_run`: fired directly after the window got shown and framework event
  loop of the used GUI framework got started.
* `on_app_stop`: fired after framework win got closed and just before the
  event loop of the GUI framework will be stopped.

.. hint::
    Some lazy/late initialization are possibly not done when the `on_app_init` or
    `on_app_start` events gets fired.
    E.g. if you want to display a debug log/console output using the
    :meth:`~ConsoleApp.debug_print` or :meth:`~ConsoleApp.dpo` method and you did not
    call explicitly :meth:`ConsoleApp._parse_args` before, then the value of the
    `debug_level` config variable not got already loaded into the instance attribute
    :attr:`~AppBase.debug_level` and you will see no debug output.


application state change events
_______________________________

The method :meth:`~MainAppBase.call_method` is also used internally by this
module for to fire notification events when one of the app state variables
gets changed - like e.g. the :ref:`application flow` or if
the user changes the font size.

The method name of the notification event consists of the prefix ``on_`` followed
by the variable name of the app state. So e.g. on a change of the `font_size` the
notification event `on_font_size` will be fired/called (if exists as a method
of the main app instance).


application flow change events
______________________________

When the method :meth:`~MainAppBase.change_flow` get called for to change
the current flow, then first a flow-specific event gets fired for to
confirm the flow id change. The name of this event depends
on the new flow id and gets determined by the function
:func:`flow_event_name`. If the event handler exists and
does return `True` for to confirm the flow change then flow id and path
will be changed accordingly.

If the flow-specific event call results in a boolean `False` or `None`
then the generic event handler :meth:`~MainAppBase.on_flow_change`
will be called.

If also the generic event handler returns `False` then the action
of the new flow id will be searched within
:data:`ACTIONS_CHANGING_FLOW_WITHOUT_CONFIRMATION` and if not found
then the flow change will be rejected and :meth:`~MainAppBase.change_flow`
returns `False`

If a confirmed flow change is resulting in a `'focus'` flow action then
the event `on_flow_widget_focused` will fired and can be used by the
GUI framework for to set the focus to the widget associated to the
focus flow id.


key press events
________________

For to provide key press events to the applications that will use the new
GUI framework you have to catch the key press events of the framework,
convert/normalize them and then call the :meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework`
with the normalized modifiers and key args.

The :paramref:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework.modifiers` arg is a string
that can contain several of the following sub-strings, always in the alphabetic
order (like listed below):

* Alt
* Ctrl
* Meta
* Shift

The :paramref:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework.key` arg is a string
that is specifying the last pressed key. If the key is not representing
not a single character but a command key, then `key` will be one of the
following strings:

* escape
* tab
* backspace
* enter
* del
* enter
* up
* down
* right
* left
* home
* end
* pgup
* pgdown

On call of :meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework` this method
will try to dispatch the key press event to your application. First it will
check the app instance if it has declared a method with the name
`on_key_press_of_<modifiers>_<key>` and if so it will call this method.

If this method does return False (or any other value resulting in False)
then :meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework` will check for
a method with the same name in lower-case and if exits it will call
this method.

If also the second method does return False, then it will try to call the
event method `on_key_press` of the app instance (if exists) with the modifiers
and the key as arguments.

If the `on_key_press` method does also return False then
:meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework` will finally pass the key
press event to the original key press handler of the GUI framework
for further processing.


integrate new gui framework
---------------------------

For to integrate a new Python GUI framework you have to declare a
new class that inherits from :class:`MainAppBase` and implements at
least the abstract method :meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app`.

A minimal implementation of this method would look like::

    def init_app(self):
        return None, None

Most GUI frameworks are providing classes that need to
be instantiated for the application and for each window.
For to keep a reference to these instances within your main app class
you can use the attributes :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_app`
and :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_win` of :class:`MainAppBase`.

The initialization of the attributes :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_app`
and :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_win` is optional and can be
done e.g. within :meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app`.

.. note::
    If :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_win` is set to a window instance,
    then the window instance has to provide
    a `close` method, which will be called automatically by the
    :meth:`~MainAppBase.stop_app`.

A typical implementation of a framework-specific main app class
looks like::

    from new_gui_framework import NewFrameworkApp, MainWindowClassOfNewFramework

    class NewFrameworkMainApp(MainAppBase):
        def init_app(self):
            self.framework_app = NewFrameworkAppClass()
            self.framework_win = MainWindowClassOfNewFramework()

            return self.framework_app.start, self.framework_app.stop

:meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app` will be executed only once
at the main app class instantiation. Only the main app instance
has to initialize the GUI framework for to prepare the app startup
and has to return at least a callable for to start the event loop
of the GUI framework.

.. hint::
    Although not recommended because of possible namespace conflicts,
    one could e.g. alternatively integrate the framework application class
    as a mixin to the main app class.

For to finally startup the app the :meth:`~MainAppClass.run_app` method
has to be called from the main module of your app project.
:meth:`~MainAppBase.run_app` will then start the GUI event loop by
calling the first method that got returned by :meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app`.


optional configuration and extension
____________________________________

Most of the base implementation helper methods can be overwritten by
either the inheriting framework portion or directly by user main app
class.
