  Identifier Service
    A webservice responsible for minting identifiers, such as the Fair Research Identifiers
    Service: https://identifiers.fair-research.org/

  Identifier
    A short string that references a file or dataset.

  Minid
    A minid (Minimal Viable Identifier) is an identifier that is sufficiently simple
    to make creation and use trivial, while still having enough substance to make
    data easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).

  Namespace
    A category of identifier within the Identifier Service. The Identifier Service
    may define many namespaces, but Minid currently only has two: minid and minid.test.
    Test Minids are temporary and may be removed at a later date. Regular minids
    are permanent.
