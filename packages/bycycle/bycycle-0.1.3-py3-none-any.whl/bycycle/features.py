    """
    Segment a recording into individual cycles and compute
    features for each cycle

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1d array
        Voltage time series.
    Fs : float
        Sampling rate (Hz).
    f_range : tuple of (float, float)
        Frequency range for narrowband signal of interest (Hz).
    center_extrema : {'P', 'T'}
        The center extrema in the cycle
        'P' : cycles are defined trough-to-trough
        'T' : cycles are defined peak-to-peak
    burst_detection_method : {'consistency', 'amp'}
        Method for detecting bursts.

        ..
            'consistency': detect bursts based on the consistency of consecutive periods & amplitudes
            'amp': detect bursts using an amplitude threshold

    burst_detection_kwargs : dict | None
        Keyword arguments for function to find label cycles as in or not in an oscillation.
    find_extrema_kwargs : dict | None
        Keyword arguments for function to find peaks an troughs (:func:`~.find_extrema`)
        to change filter Parameters or boundary.By default, it sets the filter length to three
        cycles of the low cutoff frequency (`f_range[0]`).
    hilbert_increase_N : bool
        Corresponding kwarg for :func:`~.amp_by_time`
        If true, this zeropads the signal when computing the Fourier transform, which can be
        necessary for computing it in a reasonable amount of time.

    Returns
    -------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        dataframe containing several features and identifiers
        for each cycle. Each row is one cycle.
        Columns (listed for peak-centered cycles):

        - ``sample_peak`` : sample of 'x' at which the peak occurs
        - ``sample_zerox_decay`` : sample of the decaying zerocrossing
        - ``sample_zerox_rise`` : sample of the rising zerocrossing
        - ``sample_last_trough`` : sample of the last trough
        - ``sample_next_trough`` : sample of the next trough
        - ``period`` : period of the cycle
        - ``time_decay`` : time between peak and next trough
        - ``time_rise`` : time between peak and previous trough
        - ``time_peak`` : time between rise and decay zerocrosses
        - ``time_trough`` : duration of previous trough estimated by zerocrossings
        - ``volt_decay`` : voltage change between peak and next trough
        - ``volt_rise`` : voltage change between peak and previous trough
        - ``volt_amp`` : average of rise and decay voltage
        - ``volt_peak`` : voltage at the peak
        - ``volt_trough`` : voltage at the last trough
        - ``time_rdsym`` : fraction of cycle in the rise period
        - ``time_ptsym`` : fraction of cycle in the peak period
        - ``band_amp`` : average analytic amplitude of the oscillation
          computed using narrowband filtering and the Hilbert
          transform. Filter length is 3 cycles of the low
          cutoff frequency. Average taken across all time points
          in the cycle.
        - ``is_burst`` : True if the cycle is part of a detected oscillatory burst
        - ``amp_fraction`` : normalized amplitude
        - ``amp_consistency`` : difference in the rise and decay voltage within a cycle
        - ``period_consistency`` : difference between a cycleâ€™s period and the period of the
          adjacent cycles
        - ``monotonicity`` : fraction of instantaneous voltage changes between consecutive
          samples that are positive during the rise phase and negative during the decay phase

    Notes
    -----
    Peak vs trough centering
        - By default, the first extrema analyzed will be a peak,
          and the final one a trough. In order to switch the preference,
          the signal is simply inverted and columns are renamed.
        - Columns are slightly different depending on if 'center_extrema'
          is set to 'P' or 'T'.
