        # PyGEDM
        _Python bindings for the YMW16 and NE2001 electron density models_
        
        This package is a Python interface to the YMW16 and NE2001 electron density models.
        The Yao, Manchester and Wang (2017, [Astrophys. J., 835, 29](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/29/meta);
        [arXiv:1610.09448](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09448)) YMW16 electron density model, is written in C++, and the Cordes and Lazio 
        (2001, [arXiv:0207156](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/)) NE2001 model is written in FORTRAN. This package, PyGEDM, wraps these
        two codes using [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) and [f2py](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/f2py/).
        
        ### Usage
        
        Some usage examples can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/telegraphic/pygedm/tree/master/examples). 
        
        ```python
        import pygedm
        
        # calculate DM at a given distance
        DM, tau_sc = pygedm.dist_to_dm(204.0, -6.5, 200)
        
        # calculate distance for a given sky position and DM
        dist, tau_sc = pygedm.dm_to_dist(123.4, 4.0, 200)
        
        # calculate N_e density at xyz galactocentric coordinates
        ne = pygedm.calculate_electron_density_xyz(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
        
        # calculate N_e density at Galactic lat/long/distance coords
        ne = pygedm.calculate_electron_density_lbr(204.0, -6.5, 3000.0)
        
        ```
        
        The methods return astropy [Quantities](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/quantity.html#quantity), which have units attached, and can accept astropy [Angles](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/angles.html#working-with-angles) and Quantities as arguments:
        
        ```python
        import pygedm
        import astropy.units as u
        import astropy.coordinates as c
        DM = u.Quantity(10.0, unit='pc cm^-3')
        ra, dec = c.Angle(23.0, unit='hourangle'), c.Angle('-43:00:02', unit='degree')
        sky_coords = c.SkyCoord(ra, dec, frame='icrs')
        dist, tau_sc = pygedm.dm_to_dist(sky_coords.galactic.l, sky_coords.galactic.b, DM)
        
        print(dist.to('lyr'))
        >> 3362.16343117 lyr
        print(tau_sc.to('ns'))
        >> 7.758686138 ns
        ```
        
        
        ### Installation
        
        Requires `pybind11`, `astropy`, and a newish C compiler with C++11 support (Ubuntu 16.04+ default gcc will work), plus a 
        fortran compiler (generally `gfortran`).
        
        You should be able to install with:
        
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/telegraphic/pygedm
        ```
        
        Or, download this repository and install via
        
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        To run unit tests, run `python setup.py test`. Note that these tests only check the Python bindings, 
        not the underlying C/FORTRAN source code (which is not supplied with unit tests).
        
        ## YMW16 C README
        
        YMW16 is a model for the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy,
        the Magellanic Clouds and the inter-galactic medium, that can be used
        to estimate distances for real or simulated pulsars and fast radio
        bursts (FRBs) based on their position and dispersion measure.
        
        The Galactic model is based on 189 pulsars that have independently
        determined distances as well as dispersion measures, whereas simpler
        models are used for the electron density in the MC and the IGM. It is
        estimated that the 95% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will
        have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. Pulse broadening
        due to scattering in the Galactic interstellar medium, the Magellanic
        Clouds, the intergalactic medium and FRB host galaxies is estimated.
        
        As well as the ymw16 dm-distance program, we also provide a program,
        ymw16_ne, which gives the electron density at any point in the Galaxy
        or Magellanic Clouds.
        
        A paper (Yao, Manchester and Wang, 2017, [Astrophys. J., 835, 29](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/29/meta);
        [arXiv:1610.09448](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09448)) describes the model and compares its predictions
        with those of earlier Galactic electron density models. YMW16 is the
        first electron-density model to estimate extragalactic pulsar
        distances and FRB distances.
        
        To make a command-line executable version of the program, download and
        unpack the latest version of the program. Then run "make_ymw16" to
        create the executable. The environment variable YMW16_DIR may be set
        up to point at a directory containing ymw16par.txt and
        spiral.txt. Access to these files is needed at runtime.
        
        Websites allowing interactive access to the YMW16 distance model and
        download of the latest program version are available at
        http://www.xao.ac.cn/ymw16/,
        http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ymw16/ and
        https://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/ymw16/.
        
        Please report any issues or bugs at
        https://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/ymw16/issues/new/ or directly to the
        authors. Please provide an example illustrating the problem.
