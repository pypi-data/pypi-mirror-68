Description: 
        # pymonocypher
        
        This python package uses cython to wrap the Monocypher C library. 
        Monocypher is an easy to use, easy to deploy, auditable crypto library
        written in portable C.  
        
        Normal Python installations have access to a wide
        selection of quality crypto libraries.  This python binding is intended to
        communicate with other implementations that do use the Monocypher library.
        A typical application is to communicate with a microcontroller that 
        uses Monocypher.

        *   Monocypher [official site](https://monocypher.org/)
        
        The Python binding API mirrors the underlying C API, but with 
        simplifications to only pass bytes objects, not uint8_t * and length.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install directly from pypi:
        
            pip install pymonocypher
            
        You can then use pymonocypher:
        
            python
            >>> import monocypher
            >>> monocypher.blake2b(b'hello world')
