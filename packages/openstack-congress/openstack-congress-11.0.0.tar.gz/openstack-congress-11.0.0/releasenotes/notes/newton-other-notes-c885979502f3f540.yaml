features:
  - Congress now supports multi-node deployment where different components
    (policy engine, API server, and datasource drivers) may be deployed in
    separate processes on separate hosts. See deployment documentation for
    more information.
issues:
  - Ceilometer driver experiences error when retrieving the list of alarms.
    The impact is that the some ceilometer data may not be updated in Congress.
    We are currently working with the ceilometer team to find a resolution.
    Expect a resolution in the next minor release.
  - The specialized policy engine for VM placement (previously released as
    experimental) is not available in this release. Expect it to be available
    again in a future release.
