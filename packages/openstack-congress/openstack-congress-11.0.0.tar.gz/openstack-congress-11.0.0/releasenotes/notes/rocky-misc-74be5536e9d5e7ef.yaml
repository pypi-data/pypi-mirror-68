    notifications through the ``monasca_webhook`` driver.
  - Congress can now accept Vitrage alarm webhook
    notifications through the ``vitrage`` driver.
  - An extensible type system which allows data source
    drivers to specify data types for its table columns
    using both standard and custom types.

    from being specified for Monasca driver.

    no longer required. ``project_name`` may be supplied
    instead.
