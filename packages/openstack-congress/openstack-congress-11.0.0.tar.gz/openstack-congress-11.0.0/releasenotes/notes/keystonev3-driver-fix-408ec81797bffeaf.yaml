upgrade:
  - In keystonev3_driver (experimental) `users` table,
    the columns `description` and `email` have been
    removed because they are not present in keystone
    V3 API response. These columns should be removed
    from existing policy rules referring to the `users`
    table. The `project_id` column has been replaced
    by `default_project_id` because the previous
    column name was incorrect. Named column reference
    should be similarly replaced in existing policy
    rules referring to the `users` table.
