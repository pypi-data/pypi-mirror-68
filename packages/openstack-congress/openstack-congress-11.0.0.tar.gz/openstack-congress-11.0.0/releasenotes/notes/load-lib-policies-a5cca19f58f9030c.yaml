features:
  - A library of useful policies an administrator can customize and import into
    Congress. See documentation for more information.
    https://docs.openstack.org/congress/latest/user/policy-library.html
upgrade:
  - A new config option `policy_library_path` is added to the [DEFAULT]
    section. The string option specifies the directory from which
    Congress will load pre-written policies for easy activation later
    by an administrator.
    This option can be ignored if you do not want
    Congress to load pre-written policies from files.
