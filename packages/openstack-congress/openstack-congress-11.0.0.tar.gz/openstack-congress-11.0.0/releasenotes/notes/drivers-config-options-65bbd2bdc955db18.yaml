features:
  - |
    Congress now loads all in-tree drivers automatically without the need for
    special configuration using the ``drivers`` config option.
    The value of ``drivers`` config option will be silently ignored.
    To prevent a driver from being loaded, specify the driver name in the new
    config option ``disable_drivers``. To load additional third-partiy or
    downstream, specify the driver endpoint in the new config option
    ``custom_driver_endpoints``.

upgrade:
  - |
    Any of the third-party drivers added to ``drivers`` config option should add
    the corresponding endpoint to ``custom_drivers_endpoint`` to be able to load
    their drivers on service startup.

deprecations:
  - |
    ``drivers`` config option is deprecated and would be silently ignored.
