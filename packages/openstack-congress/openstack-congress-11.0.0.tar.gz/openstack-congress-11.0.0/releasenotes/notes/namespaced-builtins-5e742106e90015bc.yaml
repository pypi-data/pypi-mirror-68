prelude: >
features:
  - Builtins like plus, times, lt now have the
    namespace 'builtin'.  For example, instead
    of writing 'plus(x,y,z)' you now write
    'builtin:plus(x,y,z)'
upgrade:
  - Policies using the bare version of builtins,
    such as 'plus(x,y,z)' should be modified to
    include the 'builtin' namespace, such as
    'builtin:plus(x,y,z)'.
deprecations:
  - Builtins without the 'builtin' namespace are
    now deprecated.  They will be supported in the
    near term, but all policies should be modified
    to include the 'builtin:' prefix on all builtins.
    For example, use 'builtin:plus(x,y,z)' instead
    of 'plus(x,y,z)'.
