upgrade:
  - Added a new database table policiesdeleted to hold soft-deleted
    policies. table:policies column:name type changed from Text() to
    String(255) to support uniqueness constraint.
    Necessary migration scripts are included in congress/db/migration/.
    Migration aborts without effect if any existing policy name is longer than
    255.
