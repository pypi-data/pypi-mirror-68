features:
  - The Neutron Qos driver (`neutronv2_qos`) is added to
    make data from the Neutron QoS extension available
    to Congress for policy-based monitoring and
    enforcement.
  - In Neutron v2 driver, new actions
    (`attach_port_security_group` and
    `detach_port_security_group`) are added to enable
    Congress policy rules to attach/detach a single
    security group from a port. These actions make it
    possible to write Congress policies to manage
    network security. An example of such a policy can
    be found in
    ``library/tag_based_network_security_zone.yaml``.
  - In Nova driver, a new `tags` table is added to
    make association between Nova servers and string
    tags available to Congress for policy-based
    monitoring and enforcement. An example of
    tag-based policy can be found in
    ``library/tag_based_network_security_zone.yaml``.
issues:
  - python-mistralclient 3.2.0 causes an authentication problem in Congress
    Mistral driver. The issue was discovered too late in the release cycle to
    change the formal requirements. To avoid the issue, use alternative
    versions of python-mistralclient such as 3.3.0 or 3.1.4.
upgrade:
  - |
    The Tempest test cases for Congress has been removed
    from Congress and moved into a separate repo available
    at https://github.com/openstack/congress-tempest-plugin
  - To enable Neutron QoS data source driver, add the following class path to the
    drivers option in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section of congress config file.
    ``congress.datasources.neutronv2_qos_driver.NeutronV2QosDriver``
deprecations:
  - Congress config options `policy_path`, `datasource_file`,
    and `root_path` had been deprecated for multiple
    releases and is now removed.
  - In Aodh driver, the `alarms.threshold_rule` table has
    been removed because the rule type had been
    deprecated in Aodh since Ocata and is no longer
    available in the Queens release.
fixes:
  - In Monasca driver, an authentication issue due to
    outdated use of Keystone has been fixed.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes to improve stability and
    robustness.
