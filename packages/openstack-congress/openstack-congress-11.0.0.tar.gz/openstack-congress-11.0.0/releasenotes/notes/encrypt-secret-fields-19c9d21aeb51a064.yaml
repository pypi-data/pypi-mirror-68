upgrade:
  - A new config option `encryption_key_path` has been added to the DEFAULT
    section to specify the path to the directory containing encryption keys for
    encrypting secret fields in datasource config. The default value
    (/etc/congress/keys) works for most deployments. A new key will be
    automatically generated and placed in the directory specified by the
    config option.

security:
  - Secret fields in datasource configuration are now encrypted using Fernet
    (AES-128 CBC; HMAC-SHA256).
    Existing datasources are unaffected. To encrypt the secret
    fields of existing datasources, simply delete and re-add after Congress
    upgrade.
