features:
  - The ``nova`` data source driver now supports the
    ``hypervisors`` table, replacing the old ``hosts`` table.
upgrade:
  - Nova os-hosts API had been deprecated since Pike and
    no longer available in the latest Nova client. As a
    result, the ``hosts`` table is no longer available in
    the Nova data source driver. In its place, please use
    the new ``hypervisors`` table.
