If all else fails
==================

Congress's policy language was designed to balance the needs of the people who write complex policies (e.g. encoding the relevant fragments of HIPAA) and the needs of the software that enforces that policy.  Too rich a policy language and the software cannot properly enforce it; too poor and people cannot write the policy they care about.

Because the policy language is less expressive than a traditional programming languages, there will undoubtedly arise situations where we need to hit Congress with a hammer.  There are several ways to do that.

- Create your own cloud service
- Write the enforcement policy
- Access control policy (unimplemented)
