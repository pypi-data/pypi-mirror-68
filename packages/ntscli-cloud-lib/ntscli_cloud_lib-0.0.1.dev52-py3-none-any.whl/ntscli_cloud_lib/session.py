                        'esn': 'NFANDROID2-PRV-SHIELDANDROIDTV-NVIDISHIELD=ANDROID=TV-15894-'
                               'B870830DB5F845A545A34A536B73E1D186852F3305237B999319ED128B635374'

                ]
            }
        }

        If it is running currently, you get the key "resultTopic" instead of "lastBatch", and that will be the topic
        you can subscribe to for live monitoring.

        Example replies:

        idle and nothing having run before - after reboot probably:
        {'status': 200, 'body': {'sessions': []}}

        running:
        {'status': 200, 'body': {'sessions': [{'status': 'running', 'target': {'ip': '192.168.144.54',
        'usbId': '0323618087338', 'macAddress': '00:04:4B:B8:39:D8', 'esn': '[esn]'},
        'resultTopic': 'cloud/partner/yourCertId/more/opaque_stuff'
        }]}}

        finished:
        {'status': 200, 'body': {'sessions': [{'status': 'idle', 'target': {'ip': '192.168.144.54',
        'usbId': '0323618087338', 'macAddress': '00:04:4B:B8:39:D8', 'esn': '[esn]'},
        'lastBatch': 'ntscli-6BS9WP06-2020-03-30T20:32:57.423Z'}]}}

        The final response format includes the results list. To get this format, you must make the
        request with both a DeviceIdentifier (so A. mqtt-router knows where to route the message, and B. so Automator knows which device
        to qualify the batch_id in), and the batch ID. If any part is missing, you might get just the Automator-session status block.

        This payload includes the state of all the tests at key "results". The format of that is described next.

        The result list is a list of Dicts. Each describes the state of a test.
        The keys for an unstarted test start as:
        name, url, status

        The key 'status' is one of these:
        running, pending, passed, failed, cancelled, invalid

        Once the status goes to "running" it will get a couple more keys (not all at once):
        logfile, step

        Once it's ended in some form, you might get "error_state" as well as some log entry keys.

        Most interestingly, you can deduce your progress by measuring the index of the currently running index vs.
        the length of full_payload:

        # only somewhat accurate X of Y type of thing
