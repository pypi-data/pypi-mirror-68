SEARCHING
---------
The purpose of Zeitzono's city search is to find cities as quickly as
possible.

Search: TERM1 [TERM2 [TERM3]] ...

Entering a search term will search cities that match TERM1.

Entering more search terms will search cities for match all given
patterns.

If any search term is prefixed with a colon (":"), that pattern will
search against the name of the country or the admin1 (aka state or
province) or admin2 (usually county) names.


EXAMPLES
--------
A search for "peter" will match a number of cities that contain that
name including St Petersburg in Russia and the United States.

A search for "peter boro" will match two cities named Peterborough in
the UK and Canada.

A search for "peter boro :can" will match the Canadian city by that name.

Searching for a city name will match against the city name as well as an
alternative names list. So a search for "Bombay" will match "Mumbai".

A search for "apple" will bring up New York City as a result, because
"The Big Apple" is an alternate name for NYC.

A search for "can" will result in several hundred search results (only a
few which can be show on the screen). A search for ":australia" will
list all the cities in Australia, and refining the search to ":australia
can" will show the two Australian cities "Canberra" and "Canning Vale".


SELECTING A CITY
----------------
Search results are ordered such that the city with the largest
population will be at the bottom.

Hitting Enter will select the city at the bottom of the search results.

If the search results return multiple cities, selecting 0-9 will select
that particular city, where 0 selects the bottom city, and 1 selects the
city above it, etc.

Hitting Escape at any time will cancel the city search and return you to
the main window.
