## Documentation

### Render
```python
Soundboard.render(frequency,duration,amplitude,filename)
```
takes in an array of frequencies, and array of durations, and an array of amplitudes and a string filename
#### Note: The arrays must be of equal length or else the program will halt with a notice.
#### Note: The filename string must include a .wav to be playable

### Build
```python
Soundboard.build(arr)
```
takes in an 2 dimensional array - an sequence of note arrays containing 3 values, frequency, duration, and amplitude
```python
Soundboard.build([[frequency,duration,amplitude], ...])
```

#### Note: The build will fail with an error if all 3 values are not filled in for each and every note.
#### Note: Build will return a file called "Build.txt" containing numerical values for speaker positions

### Compile
```python
Soundboard.compile(filename)
```
takes in a filename
#### Note: The filename string must include a .wav to be playable
#### Note: Compile will fail if there is no "Build.txt" in the current directory.
