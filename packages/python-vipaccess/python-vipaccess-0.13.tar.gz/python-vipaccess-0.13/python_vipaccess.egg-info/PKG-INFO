Description: python-vipaccess is a free and open source software (FOSS)
        implementation of Symantec's VIP Access client.
        
        If you need to access a network which uses VIP Access for `two-factor
        authentication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication>`__,
        but can't or don't want to use Symantec's proprietary
        applications—which are only available for Windows, MacOS, Android,
        iOS—then this is for you.
        
        Symantec VIP Access actually uses a **completely open standard**
        called `Time-based One-time Password Algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm>`__
        for generating the 6-digit codes that it outputs. The only
        non-standard part is the **provisioning** protocol used to create a
        new token.

        The reverse-engineering of the VIP Access protocol was done by `Forest
        Crossman (cyrozap) <https://github.com/cyrozap>`__.  See `original
        blog post <https://www.cyrozap.com/2014/09/29/reversing-the-symantec-vip-access-provisioning-protocol>`__.
        
        ``python-vipaccess`` is now maintained by `Daniel Lenski (dlenski) <https://github.com/dlenski>`__.
