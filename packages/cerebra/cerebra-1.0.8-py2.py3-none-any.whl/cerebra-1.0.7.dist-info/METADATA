What is _cerebra_?
-------------------------------------

This tool allows you to quickly extract meaningful variant information from a DNA or RNA sequencing experiment. If you're interested in learning what mutations are present in your DNA/RNA samples, variant callers like GATK [HaplotypeCaller](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_haplotypecaller_HaplotypeCaller.php) can be used to generate variant calling format (.vcf) files following a sequencing experiment. However, a single sequencing run can generate on the order of 10^8 unique vcf entries, only a small portion of which contain meaningful biological signal. Thus drawing conclusions from .vcf files remains a substantial challange. _cerebra_ provides a fast and intuitive framework for summarizing vcf entries across samples. It is comprised of four modules that do the following:      

        1) remove germline mutations from samples of interest        
        2) count the total number of mutations in a given sample           
        3) report amino acid level SNPs and indels for each sample             
        4) report the ratio of total to variant reads to each mutation site      

_cerebra_ gets its name from the eponymous X-men [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebra), who had the ability to detect mutant individuals among the general public. 

If you're working with tumor data, it might be a good idea to limit the mutational search space to only known cancer variants. Therefore _cerebra_ implements an optional method for restricting to variants also found in the [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) database.  

NOTE: this framework was developed for, but is certainly not limited to, single-cell RNA sequencing data.

What makes _cerebra_ different from traditional vcf parsers? 
-------------------------------------
Python libraries exist (_ie._ [PyVCF](https://pyvcf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [vcfpy](https://vcfpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)) for extracting information from vcf files, and GATK has its own tool for the [task](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_variantutils_VariantsToTable.php). In fact we integrate vcfpy into our tool. What makes _cerebra_ different is that it reports the RNA transcript and amino acid change associated with each variant. GATK _VariantsToTable_ produces a file that looks like: 

    CHROM    POS ID      QUAL    AC
     1        10  .       50      1
     1        20  rs10    99      10

Such a table contains only genomic (ie. DNA-level) coordinates. Often the next question is what specific gene and protein-level mutation is each variant associated with? _cerebra_ queries a reference genome (.fa) and annotation (.gtf) to match each DNA-level variant with its associated gene, probable transcript and probable amino-acid level mutation. _cerebra_ produces a table that looks like the following:

_cerebra_ adheres to HGVS sequence variant [nomenclature](https://varnomen.hgvs.org/) in reporting peptide level variants

Installation
------------

The latest version can be installed from PyPi:       
```pip install cerebra```

Before running that you'll need to install a few dependencies. 

For OSX:     
```
sudo pip install setuptools
brew update
brew install openssl
brew install zlib
```

For Linux:     
```
apt-get install libbz2-dev
apt-get install zlib1g-dev
apt-get install libssl-dev
```
