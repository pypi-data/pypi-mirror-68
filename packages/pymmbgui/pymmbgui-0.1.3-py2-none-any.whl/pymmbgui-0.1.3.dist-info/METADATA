PyMMBgui - GUI to access BBC Microcomputer disc images

Overview
--------

**PyMMBgui** is a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface - i.e. desktop program)
to allow access to BBC Microcomputer DFS disc images, and MMB image bundles.

History
-------

The BBC Microcomputer has been around for many years (over 30 years now),
and in all that time it has supported Tape, Floppy Disk, and occasionally
small Hard Disk Drive storage (If you have a 1770 and ADFS) but thanks to
the work of a number of enthusiasts there is now an inexpensive add-on to
allow any BBC Microcomputer (even those without Floppy Disk hardware) to
access mass storage on MMC Flash Cards.

This is wonderful but then poses a further problem, how to get the disk
images that the MMC/SuperMMC/TurboMMC hardware supports onto the flash card?

There are some tools which have been used for several years, they work ok,
as long as you are running a supported version of Windows (They don't work,
for example, under Wine or CrossoverOffice), but I've found them a little
confusing. The process to create an MMB, add a new disk and put files on it
is well documented but requires several steps and provides ample opportunity
for mistakes.

Details
-------

This is where PyMMB is intended to fit in. The aim of the project is to
provide a platform independant library, command-line toolset, GUI application
and FUSE binding for managing files stored on DFS disks, contained within
MMB files.

This package is the GUI application designed to provide a simple user
interface to all the common operations you might want to perform on your DFS
or MMB files before transferring them to your BBC Microcomputer.

Requirements
------------

    - PyMMB - The library (part of the PyMMB project) which supports all
      all MMB and DFS access functionality

This package is written for Python 2.x (at least 2.5) and currently is not
supported under Python 3.x

Installation
------------

You can install PyMMBgui with your favourite egg installer. We recommend using
**pip** ::

  pip install PyMMBgui

Uninstall
---------

If you are using **pip** you can uninstall using ::

  pip uninstall PyMMBgui

Contributing
------------

Contributions of code, development time, testing, or money are welcome. If
you are kind enough to donate money, your name (and optionally company name,
and email or web address) will be listed as a sponsor.

You can join the project, see the current auto-build status, download the

    * Acorn Computers - For producing probably the most innovative computer
      for its time ever.

    * Martin Mather - For developing the original MMC Flash Card interface
      (and the MMB file format which bears his initials) for the BBC Micro.

    * Steve O'Leary - The code for FS Manager which helped me understand both
