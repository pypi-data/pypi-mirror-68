Description: # pktktimer
        I didn't like any existing pecha kucha timers, so I made my own. 
        Existing timers are either too bloated and built with silly frameworks for such a simple application, or didn't have the features I wanted, like title slide delays.
        
        ## Usage
        Just download and run `pechatimer.py`
        The following command line arguments are available:
        + `-d seconds` denotes the time the zeroth(title) slide should run for. 
        + `--no-zero-slide` starts the timer without the zeroth slide
        
        ## TODO
        + package and upload to pypi
        + more options to fine-tune variables like time/slide.
