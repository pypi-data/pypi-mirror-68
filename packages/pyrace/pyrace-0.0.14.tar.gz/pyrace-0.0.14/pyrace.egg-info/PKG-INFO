Description: 
        <h1> pyrace </h1>
        This library provides a flexible environment to practice different Reinforcment learning models.
        </br>
        <h3> Import </h3>
        
        ```sh
        from pyrace import Env
        ```
        <h3> Creat an environment </h3>
        
        ```sh
        env = Env()
        ```
        
        <h3> Env class </h3>
        The methods of this class are pretty similar to the environments provided by the gym library.
        </br>
        <b>render</b> : print an image of the current state of the environment. please make sure to turn the backend of matplotlib to auto (%matplotlib Auto)
        </br>
        <b>reset</b> : reset the environment and output tu initial state.
        </br>
        <b>step</b> : takes an action as input. An action is an array, the size and types in this array are defined by the environment's action space.This method outputs the new state.
        </br>
        <b>load</b> : Input the name of a map and it reset the environment with this new map loaded. Currently only one map is ready (map_1).So, this method is not that useful currently.
        </br>
        <b>sample_action</b> : no input, it output a random sample of the current environement's action space.
        </br>
        <b>get_model_info</b> : print the current environment's metadata. This metadata gives a description of the action space and the observation space.
        </br>
        <b>get_model_list</b> : gives the list of the names of the different available models.
        </br>
        <b>get_map_list</b> : gives the list of the names of the maps available.
