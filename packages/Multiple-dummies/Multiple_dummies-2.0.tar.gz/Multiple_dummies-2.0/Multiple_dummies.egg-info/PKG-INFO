Version: 2.0
Summary: 

This Package will implement dummy columns for a column with multiple values.

The various supported format are :

1 :host_verifications is a column with values  ['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba'] and we need to create dummy columns separately for each feature.

2 :amenites is  a column with values {TV,"Cable TV",Internet,"Wireless Internet"} and we need to create dummy columns separately for each feature.

The above two senarious are examples where this package can be used to get dummy columns embeded with original dataframe for further analysis.

Code to execute:

Step 1 :- create an object of Mdummies and provide dataframe name and column name as arguments.

from Multiple_dummies import Mdummies

dummies=Mdummies(airbnb_seatle_lis,'amenities')

step 2: call the function create dummies.

dummies.create_dummies()

Step 3 : Result obtained.

The output will be the dataframe with all the dummy columns attached to the original dataframe and the original column with multiple values will be dropped.
