    "Add Router" and "Remove Router" operations are now controlled by
    ``update_firewall`` rule in the policy.json file.
    Previously they were controlled by ``get_firewall`` rule and non-existing
    rules like ``add_router`` and ``remove_router``.
    If operators define their custom policy rules for ``add_router`` and
    ``remove_router``, such policy rules need to updated accordingly.
