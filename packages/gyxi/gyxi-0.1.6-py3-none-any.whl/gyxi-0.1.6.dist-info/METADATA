Gyxi is a free document database which basically works as a key-value (multi value) database and by allowing configuration of views, makes it possible to organize content in any way desired.

GyxiClient is ready to use without any prior registration required and you get 1 GB storage for free.

You choose a Region (from an enum) and a guid which will be your database id. Simply start using it - there is no need to sign up or register your database beforehand.

Keep your guid secret because anyone who has access to the guid has full access to your database.

Example:

.. code:: python

  from gyxi import GyxiClient, GyxiRegion

  gyxi = GyxiClient("dfca164c-b19d-4abd-a5a7-4eabdfb8b123", GyxiRegion.GERMANY)
  gyxi.save("mytype", "all", my_obj);

Please note: Use any other guid than the one from the sample above.
