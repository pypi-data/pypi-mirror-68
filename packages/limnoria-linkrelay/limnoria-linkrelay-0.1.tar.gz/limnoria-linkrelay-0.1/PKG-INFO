Description: LinkRelay is an alternative to the official Relay plugin. As Relay can
        relay only between channels with the same name, LinkRelay is highly
        configurable, and can be used to relay from any channel to any channel.
        
        More over, LinkRelay offers unique features, such as coloring the
        non-PRIVMSG messages (i.e. joins, parts, quits, kicks, nick changes, ...),
        non-reciprocal relays, or messages filtering (by regexp).
