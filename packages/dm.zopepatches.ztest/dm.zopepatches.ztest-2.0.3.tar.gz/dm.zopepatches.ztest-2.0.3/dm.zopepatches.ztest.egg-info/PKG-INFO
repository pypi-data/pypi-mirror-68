Description: This package defines the (console) script ``ztest``, a small wrapper
        around the Zope (3) testrunner to run tests of Zope (2) application components
        (often so called Zope (2) products).
        
        Until Zope 2.11, its functionality was available as ``bin/zopectl test``.
        For Zope 2.12,
        Zope developers switched to ``buildout`` for Zope development itself
        and (to save some work) dropped support for ``bin/zopectl test``.
        Thus, developers of Zope application components (like me) were forced
        either to switch to ``buildout``, to renounce testing or to build something
        like ``ztest``.
        
        My experience with ``buildout`` has not been good: compared with
        a more traditional (and more manual) ``virtualenv``,
        ``buildout`` gave me much more surprises (surprising upgrades),
        much more waiting time due to unnecessary rebuildings and was
        far less reliable (due to problems of internet servers scanned for
        sources). Therefore, I do not want to switch to ``buildout``.
        Of course, I do not want to renounce testing.
        Thus, I stiched the Zope 2.11 code together to build ``ztest``.
        
        ``ztest`` can also be used together with ``buildout``.
        A ``buildout`` part definition for ``ztest`` could look like::
        
          [ztest]
          recipe = zc.recipe.egg:scripts
          eggs =
            dm.zopepatches.ztest
            ${buildout:eggs}
          extra-paths =
            ${zope2:location}/lib/python
        
        It creates a script ``bin/ztest`` that can test packages either in
        Zope or in the available eggs.
        
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        ztest -h
          list the available options
        
        ztest [--config-file *config_file*] -s *package*
          run tests for *package*. If given, use *config_file* as the Zope
          configuration file
        
        ztest [--config-file *config_file*] --package-path *file_path_to_package* *package* -s *package*
          occationally, the testrunner is too stupid to find the tests in a package.
          Then it is necessary to specify its file path with the ``--package-path``
          option.
        
        
        History
        =======
        
        2.0
          Python 3/Zope4+ compatibility
        
          Requiring modern ``zope.testrunner`` (>= 4.9). This makes
          this release Python 3 (>= 3.3) and Python 2.7 only.
        
          New command line option ``--logging`` to activate basic logging.
        
        1.1.3
          Bugfix: a module filter was usually not effective
        
        1.1.2
          support for Zope 2.10
        
        1.1
          try to determine 'package-path' automatically by a trial import. May not always work.
