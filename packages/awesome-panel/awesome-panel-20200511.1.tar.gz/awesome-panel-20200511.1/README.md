# Awesome Panel Package

This package supports the [Awesome Panel Project](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-panel) and provides features that are not yet and maybe never will be provided by the [Panel package](https://pypi.org/project/panel/).

This package is currently **highly experimental** and

- The **api might change** dramatically and often!
    - If the Panel package starts providing the functionality, then it should be removed from this package.
- If you find a version that works for you, then please **pin the version number**!
    - An example of pinning the version number is `awesome-panel==20191208.2`.

You can install it using

```bash
pip install awesome-panel
```

The **express** module contains improved widgets and extensions like *fontawesome* and *bootstrap* as well as the *Bootstrap Dashboard Template* used by [awesome-panel.org](https://awesome-panel.org). It should be imported as `pnx`.

```python
import awesome_panel.express as pnx
```

For example the code below is used to configure the Bootstrap Dashboard App in the Gallery at awesome-panel.org.
