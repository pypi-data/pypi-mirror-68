"""Core functions for working with channels.

ChanPy's :class:`channels <chan>` have full support for use with asyncio
coroutines, callback based code, and multi-threaded designs. The functions in
this module are designed to primarily accept and produce channels and by doing
so, can be used almost identically with each of the aforementioned styles.

An extremely valuable feature from Clojure's core.async library is the ability
to cheaply create asynchronous "processes" using go blocks. ChanPy, like
`aiochan <https://github.com/zh217/aiochan>`_, is able to do something similar
by leveraging Python's own asyncio library. Channels can easily be used from
within coroutines which can then be added as tasks to an event loop. ChanPy
additionally offers ways for these tasks to be added from threads without a
running event loop.

Note:
    Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any function involving asynchronous
    work should be assumed to require an asyncio event loop. Many of these
    functions leverage the use of an event loop for the efficiency reasons
    stated earlier. Threads with a running event loop will be able to directly
    call these functions but threads without one will be required to register
    one to themselves using :func:`set_loop` prior to doing so. Calling
    :func:`set_loop` will be unnecessary for threads that were created with
    :func:`thread` as those threads will have already been registered.
