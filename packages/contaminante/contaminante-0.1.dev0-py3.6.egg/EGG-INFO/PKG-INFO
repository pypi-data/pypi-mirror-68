Description: # contaminante
        *kohn - tah - mee - nahn - teh*
        
        A package to help find the contaminant transiting source in NASA's *Kepler*, *K2* or *TESS* data. When hunting for transiting planets, sometimes signals come from neighboring contaminants. This package helps users identify where the transiting signal comes from in their data.
        
        
        ## What does `contaminante` do?
        
        `contaminante` uses pixel level modeling of the *TargetPixelFile* data from NASA's astrophysics missions that are processed with the *Kepler* pipeline. The output of `contaminante` is a figure showing
        1.  Where the main target is centered in all available TPFs.
        2.  What the phase curve looks like for the main target
        3.  Where the transiting source is centered in all available TPFs, if a transiting source is located outside the main target
        4.  The transiting source phase curve, if a transiting source is located outside the main target
        
        An example output is shown below for a target with a transiting contaminant.

        Where as a transit that is centered on the target gives the following output:

        ## How to use `contaminante`
        
        You can check out our [tutorial](https://github.com/christinahedges/contaminante/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-1_how-to-use-contaminante.ipynb) for how to run `contaminante`. To run `contaminante` you will need a target name, a transit period, a transit center and a transit duration.
