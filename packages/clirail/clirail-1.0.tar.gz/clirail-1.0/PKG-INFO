Description: # clirail
        
        Command line application for the iRail API
        
        iRail provides an API for Belgian trains.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install clirail
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Stations can be identified by name or by telegraphic code. You can learn telegraphic codes by
        looking at a liveboard in clirail, or looking at stations' Wikipedia articles.
        
        ### Liveboard
        A list of the trains departing shortly in a station.
        * `./clirail STATION`: departing ASAP
        * `./clirail STATION '' DEPARTURE_MOMENT`: departing at another moment
        
        ### Route planning
        * `./clirail FROM_STATION TO_STATION`: departing ASAP
        * `./clirail FROM_STATION TO_STATION DEPARTURE_MOMENT`: departing at another moment
        
        ### Disturbances
        A list of all recent disturbances on the network.
        * `./clirail`
        
        ## Licenses
        * clirail code is released under GNU GPLv3+.
        * xdg is released under ISC.
        
        ## Known issues
        * Provided dates will be today, even though in some cases it makes more sense to consider it
          "tomorrow" (e.g. at 11 PM planning a route with departure at 7 AM)
        * No help text yet
        
        ## Development
        To create a virtualenv and install the dependencies in it:
        ```
        tools/create_venv.py
        ```
        
        If you introduce dependencies, list them in `setup.py` under `install_requires`, and run
        `tools/update_requirements.sh`.
