0.3.0 (2020-03-01)
------------------

Features
++++++++

- Introduced `labeling`:

    * ``c.item("companies").add_label("first_company", c.item(0))`` labels the first
      company in the list as `first_company` and allows to use it as
      ``c.label("first_company") further in next and even nested conversions
  
    * ``(...).pipe`` now receives 2 new arguments: 

      * `label_input`, to put some labels on the pipe input data
      * `label_output` to put labels on the output data.

      Both can be either ``str`` (label name to put on) or ``dict`` (keys are label names
      and values are conversions to apply to the data before labeling)
  `#6 <https://github.com/itechart-almakov/convtools/issues/6>`_


Bugfixes
++++++++

- Added ``__name__`` attribute to ctx. Now internal code from the generated converter is sending to Sentry (not only file name).
  Also the generated converter became a callable object, not a function.
  `#5 <https://github.com/itechart-almakov/convtools/issues/5>`_


----


0.2.3 (2020-02-27)
------------------

Bugfixes
++++++++

- Fixed ``c.group_by((c.item("name"),)).aggregate((c.item("name"), c.reduce(...)))``.
  Previously it was compiling successfully, now it raises ``ConversionException`` on ``gen_converter``
  because there is no explicit mention of ``c.item("name")`` field in group by keys (only tuple).
  `#4 <https://github.com/itechart-almakov/convtools/issues/4>`_

------------------

Bugfixes
