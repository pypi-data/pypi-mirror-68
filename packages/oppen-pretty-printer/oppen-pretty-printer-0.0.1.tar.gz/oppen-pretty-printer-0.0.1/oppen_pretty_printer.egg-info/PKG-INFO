Description: ## oppen-pretty-printer
        
        This package is a faithful translation, to python, of the 
        pretty-printing algorithm developed by DEREK C. OPPEN at Stanford  University 
        in the late 1970s. The appendix of [PRETTY PRINTING, Derek C. Oppen, 1979] contains 
        the original prettyprint program written in [MESA]
        
        A much quoted, more recent algorithm, [A prettier printer, Philip Wadler 2003] refers to 
        Oppen, saying, "The pretty printer presented here uses an algorithm equivalent to Oppenâ€™s, but presented 
        in a functional rather than an imperative style". Many of todays pretty printer implementations
        are based on the Wadler algorithm. So, in a way, the road leads back to Derek C. Oppen, 1979.
        
        Two python versions are included. `pretty_oppen.py` is, as far as possible, a 
        line-by-line translation of the Oppen algorithm from [MESA] to Python. `pretty.py` is
        functionally identical to `pretty_oppen.py` but written using a more Pythonic idiom.
        
        Pytest tests and example output are included for both versions.
        
        
        ### Usage
        
        	pip install oppen-pretty-printer
        	
        Example:
        ```
        from oppen_pretty_printer import pprint, Token as T
        
        tokens = [
            T.BEGIN(),
            T.STRING("begin"),
            T.STRING("x"),
            T.BREAK(), T.STRING(":="), T.BREAK(),
            T.STRING("40"),
            T.BREAK(), T.STRING("+"), T.BREAK(),
            T.STRING("2"),
            T.STRING("end"),
            T.END(),
            T.EOF()]
        
        pprint(tokens)
        ```
