    'long_description': "Generate Plantuml diagrams to document your python code\n\n# How it works\n\nFrom a given path corresponding to a folder containing python code, `py2puml` loads each file as a module and generate a class diagram with the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/en/class-diagram) using:\n\n* inspection to detect the classes to document (see the [inspect](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html) module)\n* annotations (the python type hinting syntax) to detect the attributes and their types (see the [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module)\n\nCurrent limitations:\n\n* type hinting is optional when writing the code and discarded when it is executed, as mentionned in the official documentation. The quality of the diagram output by `py2puml` depends on the reliability with which the annotations were written\n\n> The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations. They can be used by third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.\n\n* complex type hints with more than one level of genericity are not properly handled for the moment: `List[MyClass]` or `Dict[str, MyClass]` are handled properly, `Dict[str, List[MyClass]]` is not. If your domain classes (also called business objects or DTOs) have attributes with complex type hints, it may be a code smell indicating that you should write a class which would better represent the business logic. But I may improve this part of the library as well ðŸ˜€\n\n* composition relationships are detected and drawn. Inheritance relationships are not handled for now\n\n* `py2puml` does not inspect sub-folders recursively, but it is planned\n\n* `py2puml` outputs diagrams in PlantUML syntax, which can be saved in text files along your python code and versioned with them. To generate image files, use the PlantUML runtime or a docker image (see [think/plantuml](https://hub.docker.com/r/think/plantuml))\n\n* `py2puml` uses features of python 3 (generators for example) and thus won't work with python 2 runtimes. It relies on native python modules and uses no 3rd-party library, except [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) as a development dependency for running the unit-tests\n\nYou may also be interested in this [lucsorel/plantuml-file-loader](https://github.com/lucsorel/plantuml-file-loader) project: A webpack loader which converts PlantUML files into images during the webpack processing (useful to [include PlantUML diagrams in your slides](https://github.com/lucsorel/markdown-image-loader/blob/master/README.md#web-based-slideshows) with RevealJS or RemarkJS).\n\n# Install\n\nInstall from the github repository:\n\n* with `pip`:\n\n```sh\npip3 install git+https://github.com/lucsorel/py2puml.git\n```\n\n* with [poetry](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):\n\n```sh\npoetry add git+https://github.com/lucsorel/py2puml.git\n```\n\n* with [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):\n\n```sh\n# should be installed in editable mode to ensure an up-to-date copy of the repository and that it includes all known dependencies -> '-e'\npipenv install -e git+https://github.com/lucsorel/py2puml.git#egg=py2puml\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nFor example, to create the diagram of the classes used by `py2puml`:\n\n* import the py2puml function in your script (see [py2puml/example.py](py2puml/example.py)):\n\n```python\nfrom py2puml.py2puml import py2puml\n\n# outputs the PlantUML content in the terminal\nprint(''.join(py2puml('py2puml/domain', 'py2puml.domain')))\n\n# writes the PlantUML content in a file\nwith open('py2puml/domain.puml', 'w') as puml_file:\n    puml_file.writelines(py2puml('py2puml/domain', 'py2puml.domain'))\n```\n\n* running it (`python3 -m py2puml.example`) will output the PlantUML diagram in the terminal and write it in a file\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\nclass py2puml.domain.umlattribute.UmlAttribute {\n  name: str\n  type: str\n}\nclass py2puml.domain.umlclass.UmlClass {\n  name: str\n  fqdn: str\n  attributes: List[UmlAttribute]\n}\nclass py2puml.domain.umlcomposition.UmlComposition {\n  compound_fqdn: str\n  component_fqdn: str\n}\npy2puml.domain.umlclass.UmlClass *-- py2puml.domain.umlattribute.UmlAttribute\n@enduml\n```\n\nWhich renders like this:\n\n![](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/ZP0_2y8m4CNtV8gRXNPmx5HnTNKIaMWY199Bp5s68ltkfi7KWlXd-xrty7uXFR6Cd9mL5ok980pha5Ehl9C6suoIEPfpOjtkdTtK07S1WDBf3eXZPXx2ayUFKwMVPhOJl4rSRmehprRgO6U83qlvyPl3k-39iF5OJAzOVEMSK9rcMIrH8o_QKVny_wff_lulqMjK-Ve0)\n\n# Tests\n\n```sh\npoetry run python3 -W ignore::DeprecationWarning -m pytest -v\n```\n\n# Licence\n\nUnless stated otherwise all works are licensed under the [MIT license](http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html), a copy of which is included [here](LICENSE).\n\n# Contributions\n\n* [Luc Sorel-Giffo](https://github.com/lucsorel)\n\nPull-requests are welcome and will be processed on a best-effort basis.\n\n\n# Alternatives\n\nIf `py2uml` does not meet your needs (suggestions and pull-requests are welcome), you can have a look at these projects which follow other approaches (AST, linting, modeling):\n\n* [cb109/pyplantuml](https://github.com/cb109/pyplantuml)\n* [deadbok/py-puml-tools](https://github.com/deadbok/py-puml-tools)\n* [caballero/genUML](https://github.com/jose-caballero/genUML)\n",
