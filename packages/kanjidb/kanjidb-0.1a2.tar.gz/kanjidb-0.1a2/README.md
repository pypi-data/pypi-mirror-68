Kanji database builder and REST API.

KanjiDB aims to help you build your own kanji database by compiling
informations from various existing source into a single JSON file.
It's plugin system let you write you own plugin to collect and add new data to kanjis,
or to arrange already written plugins to meet your needs. It's goal
is to be flexible enough to let you export all the informations you
need to build your own app (database, viewer, Anki deck builder, ...) and
progress in learning Japanese. KanjiDB also comes with a REST API allowing to
retrieve those informations and build services uppon.

## Online demo

You can test the REST API online at [kanjidb.jeremymorosi.com/api/v1/doc](http://kanjidb.jeremymorosi.com/api/v1/doc):

The documentation is generated by `aiohttp_swagger`.

## Install

Using pip:

```bash
pip install kanjidb
```

Show help:

```bash
python -m kanjidb -h

Usage:  kanjidb COMMAND [OPTIONS]

A kanji database accessible via REST API

Options:
  -v, --version            Print version information and quit
  -h, --help               Show this help

Commands:
  build       Build kanji database from sources
  run         Run local server and REST API

Run 'kanjidb COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.

```

## Generating a JSON database

Create a `kanjis.txt` file containing one UTF-8 encoded kanji per line. This is the list of kanjis
that will be included in our database:

```
一
二
三
```

Now, create a `config.yml` file containing:

```yaml
run:
- kanjidic2:
    kd2_file: path/to/kanjidic2.xml
    inputs:
    - type: stream
      encoding: utf8
      separator: "\n"
      path: path/to/kanjis.txt
    outputs:
    - type: stream
      indent: 4
      path: path/to/db.json
```

In this configuration:
  * **kanjistream**: is a plugin that generate a JSON dict with data from a Kanjidic2 XML file.
  * **path/to/kanjidic2.xml**: is the path to a Kanjidic2 XML file ([download here](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project)).
  * **path/to/kanjis.txt**: is the path to the `kanjis.txt` file.
  * **path/to/db.json**: is the destination of generated JSON database.

Run the following command:

```bash
python -m kanjidb build config.yml
```

This generate a `db.json` file containing the generated JSON database.
Depending on your configuration this file can be quite big, so here is only an example of what you
would obtain:

```json
{
    "一": {
        "meanings": [{"m_lang": "", "value": "one"}]
    },
    "二": {
        "meanings": [{"m_lang": "", "value": "two"}]
    },
    "三": {
        "meanings": [{"m_lang": "", "value": "three"}]
    }
}
```

You can read more about the `kanjidic2` plugin and its configuration [here](https://kanjidb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#kanjidic2).

## Running the REST API

Now we will run a local server with a REST API allowing us to query informations from generated `db.json` file.

First, create a `config.cnf` file containing:

```ini
[service]
port = 8080
base-url = /api/v1
swagger-yml = /path/to/swagger.yml
swagger-url = /api/v1/doc
db-file = /path/to/db.json
```

Just replace:
  * **/path/to/swagger.yml**: by the path to your local [`swagger.yml`](https://github.com/Nauja/kanjidb/blob/master/etc/swagger.yml) file.
  * **/path/to/db.json**: by the path to your generated `db.json` file.

Now run:

```bash
python -m kanjidb run /path/to/config.cnf/directory/
```

You should see:

```bash
======== Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 ========
(Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

Meaning the service is up and ready.

You can access it via:
 * http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/doc: Swagger documentation
 * http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/kanji: list all kanjis in database.

Note that this repository also include a default `config.cnf`, `swagger.yml` and
`db.json` file you can use to run the server. Simply checkout this repository and run:

```bash
python -m kanjidb run etc
```

## Running with Docker

You can build a Docker image by downloading this repository and running:

```bash
docker build -t kanjidb:latest .
```

Next, run the Docker image as:

```bash
docker run \
 -v /path/to/etc:/etc/service \
 -v /path/to/log:/var/log/service \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 -it kanjidb:latest
```

Where:
  * **/path/to/etc**: is the path to the service directory containing **config.cnf**.
  * **/path/to/log**: is the path to the directory where you wan't to store logs.
  * **8080**: is the public port to access the REST API.

You should see:

```bash
======== Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 ========
(Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

Meaning the service is up and ready.

## Testing

The `test` directory contains many tests that you can run with:

```python
python setup.py test
```

Or with coverage:

```python
coverage run --source=kanjidb setup.py test
```
