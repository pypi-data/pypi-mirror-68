This is a non-exhaustive list of related, open-source projects for analysis of
EBSD data that users of KikuchiPy might find useful:

- `EMsoft <http://vbff.materials.cmu.edu/EMsoft>`_: Series of Fortran programs
  which, among numerous other tasks, can perform dictionary indexing of EBSD and
  Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) patterns.
- `MTEX <https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/>`_: Matlab toolbox for analyzing and
  modeling crystallographic textures by means of EBSD or pole figure data.
- `AstroEBSD <https://github.com/benjaminbritton/AstroEBSD>`_: Matlab package
  with indexing tools for EBSD patterns.
- `xcdskd <https://xcdskd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_: Python library
  with tools for Kikuchi Diffraction in the SEM, plus detailed Jupyter Notebooks
  explaining its use.
- `OpenXY <https://github.com/BYU-MicrostructureOfMaterials/OpenXY>`_: Matlab
  tool for performing cross-correlation analysis of EBSD patterns using real and
  simulated patterns.
