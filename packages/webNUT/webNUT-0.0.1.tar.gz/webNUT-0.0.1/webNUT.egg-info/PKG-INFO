        ======

        [python-nut2][2].

        ## Setup
        
        Rename `webnut/config.example.py` to `webnut/config.py` and set the
        variables in that file to reflect your NUT server configuration. Then
        serve webNUT as you would any Pyramid app, using `pserve` or through
        your production-ready server of choice.
        
        ## Screenshots
        
        The index lists available UPS devices, along with their description,
        status, and battery charge:
        
        ![Index](screenshots/ups_index.png "Index")
        
        Clicking on a UPS's name takes you to a details view that shows a quick
        status indicator, as well as the values of all variables set on the
        device:
