Description: # steam-sync
        Simple command line tool to automatically add games from the Epic Games Launcher
        to Steam.
        
        Makes playing all of those free EGS games in Big Picture Mode a lot easier.
        
        ## Installation (brief)
        Requires > Python 3.6 and Windows
        
        ```console
        $ pip install steamsync
        $ steamsync.py
        ```
        
        ## Installation and Usage (command lines are scary!)
        
        1. [Download Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        2. Choose the latest version of Python 3.8, and get the "Windows x86-64 executable installer" option
        3. When installing Python, make sure to install pip and to *add Python to your PATH*
        4. Open Commmand Prompt (search Start Menu for cmd.exe)
        5. Type `pip install steamsync`, press enter. 
        6. Type `steamsync`
        
        ### FAQ
        #### Does this work on OSX?
        First of all, wow Mac gamers exist. Second of all, it *should* work if you supply
        `--egs-manifests` and `--steam-path`, maybe. Good luck
        
        #### What about Linux?
        If you get EGS working on Linux, you probably don't need this tool.
        
        #### It doesn't work!
        Open an issue on GitHub.
