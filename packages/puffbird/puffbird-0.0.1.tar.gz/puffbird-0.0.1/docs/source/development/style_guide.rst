Style Guide
===========

*puffbird* follows the `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
standard and uses `Flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ to ensure a
consistent code format throughout the project.

Patterns
========

Using foo.__class__
-------------------


puffbird uses 'type(foo)' instead 'foo.__class__' as it is making the code more
readable.
For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "bar"
    type(foo)

**Bad:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "bar"
    foo.__class__


String formatting
=================

Concatenated strings
--------------------

Using f-strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

puffbird uses f-strings formatting instead of '%' and '.format()' string formatters.

The convention of using f-strings on a string that is concatenated over several lines,
is to prefix only the lines containing values which need to be interpreted.

For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "old_function"
    bar = "new_function"

    my_warning_message = (
        f"Warning, {foo} is deprecated, "
        "please use the new and way better "
        f"{bar}"
    )

**Bad:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "old_function"
    bar = "new_function"

    my_warning_message = (
        f"Warning, {foo} is deprecated, "
        f"please use the new and way better "
        f"{bar}"
    )

White spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only put white space at the end of the previous line, so
there is no whitespace at the beginning of the concatenated string.

For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    example_string = (
        "Some long concatenated string, "
        "with good placement of the "
        "whitespaces"
    )

**Bad:**

.. code-block:: python

    example_string = (
        "Some long concatenated string,"
        " with bad placement of the"
        " whitespaces"
    )

Representation function (aka 'repr()')
--------------------------------------

puffbird uses 'repr()' instead of '%r' and '!r'.

The use of 'repr()' will only happen when the value is not an obvious string.

For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    value = str
    f"Unknown received value, got: {repr(value)}"

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    value = str
    f"Unknown received type, got: '{type(value).__name__}'"


Imports (aim for absolute)
==========================

In Python 3, absolute imports are recommended. Using absolute imports, doing something
like ``import string`` will import the string module rather than ``string.py``
in the same directory. As much as possible, you should try to write out
absolute imports that show the whole import chain from top-level puffbird.

Explicit relative imports are also supported in Python 3 but it is not
recommended to use them. Implicit relative imports should never be used
and are removed in Python 3.

For example:

::

    # preferred
    from puffbird.frame import FrameEngine

    # not preferred
    from .frame import FrameEngine

    # wrong
    from frame import FrameEngine
