Description: ========
        PatchLab
        ========
        
        A Django application designed to run with Patchwork to mirror patches to GitLab.
        
        Development Environment
        =======================
        
        The easiest method to set up a development environment is to use Vagrant. On
        Fedora::
        
            $ sudo dnf install vagrant libvirt vagrant-libvirt vagrant-sshfs ansible
            $ vagrant up
        
        This sets up two virtual machines. You can ssh to them with ``vagrant ssh pw``
        and ``vagrant ssh gitlab``. The ``pw`` host contains the development
        installation of PatchLab.
        
        GitLab
        ------
        
        GitLab's web UI is available at https://localhost:8443/. You'll be prompted for
        a password, set one and you'll be able to log in with it and the username
        "root". Cloning over SSH is available on localhost:2222.
        
        Before you can set up a web hook you need to allow web hooks to private networks
        by navigating to https://localhost:8443/admin/application_settings/network and
        checking the "Allow requests to the local network from web hooks and services"
        box in the Outbound requests section.
        
        Patchwork
        ---------
        
        The Patchwork web UI is available at http://localhost:8000/. Before you can log
        in you need to make a super user account; you can do so with::
        
            $ vagrant ssh pw
            $ workon patchlab
            $ python manage.py createsuperuser
        
        Once you've created a super user you can log into the Django admin interface at
        http://localhost:8000/admin/.
