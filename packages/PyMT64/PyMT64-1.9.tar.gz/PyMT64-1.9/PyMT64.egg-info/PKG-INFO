Description: # PyMT64 Package
        
                             PyMT64
                             
        PyMT64 is a Python version of the Mersenne Twister (MT) 64-bit pseudorandom number generator by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto (see http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt64.html and the references below).
        
        This customised version is thread safe and was interfaced from C to Python (see pymt64.c)
        
        This module provides the following methods:
        - init : initialization of the state vector (mt) used by the pseudorandom number generator (PNG)
        - uniform : generation of an uniform distribution
        - normal : generation of two Normal distributions
        - poisson : generation of a Poisson distribution
        
        The period of the PNG is 2**19937-1.
        
        Example:
            import pymt64
            seed = 143439545 seed # the initial seed
            mt = pymt64.init(seed) # initialisation of the state vector of MT
            u = pymt64.uniform(mt,10) # generation of an uniform distribution
            print (u)
            [0.12444525 0.22084376 0.31059967 0.45578589 0.84743752 0.28825306
            0.83320389 0.05085032 0.48682253 0.17667076]
        
        For a complete example, see pymt64_test.py
        
        Note: the state vector 'mt' returned by pymt64.init has 313 elements instead of the 312 elements of the original C code. This is because the 313th element store the associated counter (mti).
        
        Change history:
        1.9 : correct bug associated with the normal distribution
        1.8 : include a missing file
        1.7 : corrected data package contain
        1.6 : correct wrong size of the state vector 
        1.5 : module interface is now based on Cython, module now compatible with python 3
        1.4 : link problem fixed
        1.3 : fixe a compilation problem regading the Numpy include directory
        1.2 : the previous implementation of the poisson distribution was not thread safe
        1.1 : fix a problem with the initialization of the seed  (in the previous version the seed set by init() was not taken into account such that the results were not reproductible)
        1.0 : initial version
