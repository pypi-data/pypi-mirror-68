        ## Installation
        
        This is the recommended way to install carpyncho.
        
        ### Installing  with pip
        
        Make sure that the Python interpreter can load carpyncho code.
        The most convenient way to do this is to use virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, and pip.
        
        After setting up and activating the virtualenv, run the following command:
        
        ``` console
        $ pip install carpyncho
        ...
        ```
        
        That should be it all.
        
        ### Installing the development version
        
        If you’d like to be able to update your carpyncho code occasionally with the latest bug fixes and improvements, follow these instructions:
        
        Make sure that you have Git installed and that you can run its commands from a shell.
        (Enter *git help* at a shell prompt to test this.)
        
        Check out carpyncho main development branch like so:
        
        ``` console
        $ git clone https://github.com/carpyncho/carpyncho-py.git carpyncho
        ...
        ```
        
        This will create a directory *carpyncho* in your current directory.
        
        Then you can proceed to install with the commands
        
        ```console
        $ cd carpyncho
        $ pip install -e .
        ...
        ```
