# tree_matching_distance

An implementation of the tree distance metric suggested by Lin, Rajan, and Moret, at ISBRA 2011.


## Description

This package contains a function to import and provides a command-line tool that compares two given
trees and return a distance between them.

## Usage

Run the program like

```shell
  tree_matching_distance t1.tree t2.tree
```

where the two file parameters contain trees in Newick format on the same taxa.

To use the distance method from within your own code, write
```python
  from ete3 import Tree
  from tree_matching_distance import distance
  t1 = Tree('((a, b), (c, d));')
  t2 = Tree('((a, c), (b, d));')
  d = distance(t1, t2)
  print(d)
```
for a simple test. Note that this package requires ETE3 trees.
