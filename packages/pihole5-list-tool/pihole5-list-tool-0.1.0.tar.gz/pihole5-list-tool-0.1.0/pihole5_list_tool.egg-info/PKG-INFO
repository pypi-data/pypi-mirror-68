Description: # pihole5-list-tool
        This tool allows quickly bulk adding __block lists__ to your [Pi-hole 5](https://pi-hole.net/) setup.
        
        
        Currently there are three _sources_ available to use:
        - [firebog.net](https://firebog.net/)
          - Non-crossed lists: For when someone is usually around to whitelist falsely blocked sites
          - Ticked lists: For when installing Pi-hole where no one will be whitelisting falsely blocked sites
          - All lists: For those who will always be around to whitelist falsely blocked sites
        -  A file you have
        -  Pasting in a list
        
        
        The source of each list is visible in the web interface and an option to load the lists for immediate use is available after adding.
        
        ## installation
