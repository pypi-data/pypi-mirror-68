No "View Source" necessary.\n\n## Responsive & pleasant to use\n\nThe Castor browser doesn\'t have visual indicators at all, for example, when\nclicking on a link it just appears to do nothing until the new page is\ncompletely loaded. That is A Bad Thing (tm).\n\n## Lightweight\n\nIn terms of both disk space & memory/cpu usage.\nIt\'s completely unoptimized at the moment.\nActually the way I\'m hooking up tkinter and curio is... not ideal. See comments\nin controller.py for more info. TL;DR I\'m prioritizing gui responsiveness and\ncode simplicity, sacrificing a non-negligible amount of CPU cycles even at\nidle.\n\n\n# Server bugs/surprises\n\n## Forces gemini:// in request\n\nSpec says protocol part is optional, but if I omit that one the server will\nrespond with `53 No proxying to other hosts!`.\n\n## Newline\n\nSpec says a newline should be \\r\\n but the server running\ngemini.circumlunar.space just uses \\n every time.\n',
