This is a list of similar sounding words that I have collected from various sources on the web
and added to as I find new pairs.

Unlike most homophone, homograph, and homonym resources this list is not targeting
ESL or educational use. Instead it is designed for finding common errors in speech recognition texts.
Specifically I use it with [Caster](https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for voice programming.

I currently have five different sources. I've downloaded their contents into the [data](./data)
directory as text files, or in one case HTML and parsed appropriately.
I have also linked to the original location of these files both inside the files
and in the headings between Jupyter cells in the notebook.

Unfortunately I wasn't thinking about reproducibility when I started this project,
so most of the text files have had a bit of light preprocessing in a text editor.
