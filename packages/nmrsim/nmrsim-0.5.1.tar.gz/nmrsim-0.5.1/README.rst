nmrsim (version 0.5.1 beta)
============================

**nmrsim** is a Python library for the simulation of solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.

The project is inspired by the program `WINDNMR <https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/plt/windnmr.htm>`_ by Hans
Reich. The goal for Version 1.0 of **nmrsim** is to provide Python tools for the same types of simulations that
WINDNMR did--first- and second-order simulation of spin-1/2 spin systems, plus simulation of some dynamic NMR (DNMR)
lineshapes. A longer-term goal is to expand the toolset (e.g. to allow higher-spin nuclei, or new DNMR models).

Features
--------
* Class-based abstractions for NMR features (:code:`nmrsim.Multiplet`; :code:`nmrsim.SpinSystem`;
  :code:`nmrsim.Spectrum`).
* Convenience functions for quickly plotting simulation results (:code:`nmrsim.plt`).
* A lower-level API for more "hands-on" calculation of NMR spectra (e.g. functions for creating and solving spin
  Hamiltonians in :code:`nmrsim.qm`).

Examples
--------

See the Jupyter folder for examples of typical use cases.

Installation
------------

:code:`pip install nmrsim`
