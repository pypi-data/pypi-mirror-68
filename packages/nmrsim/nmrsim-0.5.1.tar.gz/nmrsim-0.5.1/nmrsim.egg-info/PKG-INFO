        ============================
        
        **nmrsim** is a Python library for the simulation of solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra.
        
        The project is inspired by the program `WINDNMR <https://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/plt/windnmr.htm>`_ by Hans
        Reich. The goal for Version 1.0 of **nmrsim** is to provide Python tools for the same types of simulations that
        WINDNMR did--first- and second-order simulation of spin-1/2 spin systems, plus simulation of some dynamic NMR (DNMR)
        lineshapes. A longer-term goal is to expand the toolset (e.g. to allow higher-spin nuclei, or new DNMR models).
        
        Features
        --------
        * Class-based abstractions for NMR features (:code:`nmrsim.Multiplet`; :code:`nmrsim.SpinSystem`;
          :code:`nmrsim.Spectrum`).
        * Convenience functions for quickly plotting simulation results (:code:`nmrsim.plt`).
        * A lower-level API for more "hands-on" calculation of NMR spectra (e.g. functions for creating and solving spin
          Hamiltonians in :code:`nmrsim.qm`).
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        See the Jupyter folder for examples of typical use cases.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        :code:`pip install nmrsim`

        for details on installing a developer version into a virtual environment.
