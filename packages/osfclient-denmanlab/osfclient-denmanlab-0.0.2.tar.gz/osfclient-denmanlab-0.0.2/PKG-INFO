        This is a small modification of the osfclient package to allow for use with the Denman Lab 
        at the University of Colarado School of Medicince's experimental workflow
        
        The ``osfclient`` is a python library and a command-line client for up-
        and downloading files to and from your `Open Science
        Framework <//osf.io>`__ projects. The *Open Science Framework* (OSF) is
        an open source project which facilitates the open collaboration of
        researchers on the web, by sharing data and other research outputs.
        
        As such the OSF hosts large data sets, associated with papers or
        scientific projects, that can be freely downloaded. The *osfclient*
        allows people to store and retrieve large datasets associated to their
        scientific projects and papers on the OSF via the command line
        interface. If you are completely new to the OSF you can `read their
        introductory materials <https://cos.io/our-products/open-science-framework/>`__
        
        This is a very new project, it has some rough edges.

        Installing
        ==========
        
        To use ``osfclient`` install it via pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install osfclient
        
        For details on participating in the development of ``osfclient`` check
        out the `Contributing
        section <https://github.com/dib-lab/osf-cli#contributing>`__.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        This project provides two things: a python library and a command-line
        program for interacting with files stored in the
        `OSF <https://osf.io/>`__.
        
        The python library forms the basis for the command-line program. If you
        want programmatic access to your files use the library, otherwise try
        out the command-line program.
        
        Read the full documentation: http://osfclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        
        Below are some examples on how to use it:
        
        ::
        
            # get help and see available commands, get help on a specific command
            $ osf -h
            $ osf <command> -h
        
            # setup a local folder for an existing project
            $ osf init
        
            # list all files for the project
            $ osf ls
        
            # fetch all files for the project
            $ osf clone
            
            # fetch an individual file from a project
            $ osf fetch remote/path.txt local/file.txt
            
            # add a new file
            $ osf upload local/file.txt remote/path.txt
        
            # add a new directory
            $ osf upload -r local/directory/ remote/directory
        
        If the project is private you will need to provide authentication
        details. The password will be retrieved from the ``OSF_PASSWORD``
        environment variable or you will be asked directly by the tool when you
        run it.
        
        You can set default values by using a configuration file in the
        current directory. This is what ``osf init`` does for you. To set the
        username and project ID create ``.osfcli.config``:
        
        ::
        
            [osf]
            username = yourOSFaccount@example.com
            project = 9zpcy
        
        after which you can simply run ``osf ls`` to list the contents of the
        project.
