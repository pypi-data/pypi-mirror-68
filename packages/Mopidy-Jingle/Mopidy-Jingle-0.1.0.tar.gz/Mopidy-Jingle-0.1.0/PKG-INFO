Description: # Mopidy-Jingle
        
        A [Mopidy](http://www.mopidy.com/>) extension that plays jingles between tracks.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install by running `pip install Mopidy-Jingle`
        
        ## Configuration
        
        There is only two properties to setup `media_dir` which points to the folder where the jingles are. And `every_x` which define how often a jingle should be played.
        
        ```
        [jingle]
        media_dir = /home/jingles
        every_x = 1
        ```
        
        ## Jingles
        
        Jingles should be in `.wav` and have a sample rate of 96000 hz.
        You can use the script `script/gen_jingles.sh` to generate some jingles with a text-to-speech engine. The script uses `espeak` as tts engine and `sox` to modify the sample rate.
