* Create virtualenv (Optionnaly you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) which is a Python Virtualenv Manager in combination with **Poetry**)
```bash
poetry shell
```
* Install dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```
* Install pre-commit (using [Pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/))

```
