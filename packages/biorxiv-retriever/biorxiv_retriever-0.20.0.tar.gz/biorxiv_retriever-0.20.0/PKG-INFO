Description: # BiorxivRetriever
        Simple python retriever for Biorxiv articles.
        
        # Purpose
        Given a text query, search for relevant papers on Biorxiv and get their links and content.
        
        # Install
        
        Install with pip:
        ```
        pip install biorxiv_retriever
        ```
        
        Alternatively, clone this repo and install:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/TalSchuster/BiorxivRetriever.git
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        # API
        ```
        from biorxiv_retriever import BiorxivRetriever
        br = BiorxivRetriever()
        papers = br.query('covid remdesivir')
        ```
        To get only titles and links without metadata and full text (when possible):
        ```
        papers = br.query('covid remdesivir', metadata=False, full_text=False)
        ```
        
        To use [Rxivist](https://www.rxivist.org/) as the search engine (provides extra metadata but doesn't have all papers):
        ```
        br = BiorxivRetriever(search_engine='rxivist')
        ```
        
        # Output
        
        Example output:
        ```

        'abstract': 'Abstract Influenza A virus and coronavirus strains cause a mild to severe respiratory disease that can result in death. Although vaccines exist against circulating influenza A viruses, such vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic influenza A viruses. Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. In January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified enisamium as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries. Here we show using in vitro assays that enisamium and its putative metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the activity of the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. VR17-04 displays similar efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate. These results suggest that enisamium is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis, and implicate it as a possible therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike remdesivir, enisamium does not require intravenous administration which may be advantageous for the development of COVID-19 treatments outside a hospital setting.',
