        ## 1. Disclaimer and license
        ### Disclaimer
        I use the word "random" for the data generated by this library. Thought, all of
        this is **mathematically false**. So do not use this for any serious purpose.

        # 3. Usage examples
        To build the digits calculator and compute:
        ```py
        from piran import build, compute
        build() # pi.c -> pi.so
        compute(10000) # Ten thousand digits!
        ```
        Note that this is only needed once. Ten thousand digits are usually computed in
        less than a second.
        Now we can really use the library:
        ```py
        from piran import Random
        r = Random() # Creates a cursor file
        for i in range(10):
            print("unsigned int:", r.uint(10), "\nsigned int:", r.sint(-10, 10))
        
        r.close() # Deletes the cursor file
        ```
        
        # 4. Explanations
        I'm actually not very good at math. But we all know that:
        > Pi is an irrationnal number. Thus, its decimals never repeat themselves.
        
        So I worked on the (mathematically false) assumption that if pi's decimals never
        repeat themselves, then these decimals can be considered "random".
