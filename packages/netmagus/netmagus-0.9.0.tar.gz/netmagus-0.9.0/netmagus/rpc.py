"""
Normally a Form (as defined in the netmagus.form module) is used to
represent individual NetMagus UI screens
and does data exchange with formula code via file exchange or RPC messages.

Within a given formula, a user may choose to have multiple real-time data
exchanges between the NetMagus UI and the formula itself.  To do this,
the below RPC methods and data object classes can be used to do WAMP based
RPC calls to pass messages to/from the UI instead of using file-based JSON
exchanges.

A sample usage pattern to send a new screen would be:
- usernameinput = netmagus.form.TextInput(label='username')
- message_to_user = netmagus.rpc.Form(name="Username Input",
description="Enter your user name below",
form=[usernameinput])
- netmagus.rpc.rpc_connect('ws://nmhostaddress:8080/ws', 'netmagus')
- username = netmagus.rpc.rpc_form_query(token, myformobject, poll=.5,
timeout=60)
    - here the UI will update and show the form, and wait for user to enter
    the data and press submit
    - once user presses submit the response will be waitig for rcp_receive to
    pick it up
    - rpc_form_query polls the RPC looking for a reponse from the user at
    'poll' interval and stop at 'timeout' if no repsonse received
- use normal try logic to determine if timeout occurred by catching the
RpcCallTimeout exception and handling it

A user can write these as a series of synchronous interactions with the UI to
allow a single formula step to gather numerous pieces of information,
make branched execution decisions, or collapse many formula steps into one.

This allows formula writers to avoid having to adopt async programming
constructs to interact with the NetMagus UI since the typical NetMagus user
experience is a step-by-step "wizard" like approach with code blocks executed
between each interaction.

To display simple HTML updates to a user, use pattern such as:
mymessage = netmagus.rpc.Html(append=True, title='Important User Update!',
data="<p>Processing your input now...</p>")
netmagus.rpc.rpc_send(token, mymessage)

This will fire a RPC message to the UI which will then display the data
within the user's screen
