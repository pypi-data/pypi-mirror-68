class NetMagusSession(object):
    """
    This class is a wrapper to handle an interactive session between the
    NetMagus backend and a user script.  It serves as a unifed API for user
    script operations to send/receive data with the NetMagus backend.  It
    also serves as a unified API for the NetMagus backend to call and execute
    user scripts.

    The NetMagus backend will call the module as (ex.):
        ``python -m netmagus --script user.py --token aBcDeF --input-file
        /some/path/to/aBcDeF.json --loglevel 10``

    The "token" is used by NM to desginate all file and RPC interactions tied
    to a given execution.

    This class will be called by the module's __main__.py to:
     - read JSON from the NetMagus backend via the input-file if it exists
     - read in any previous state tied to the token/session
     - import the user's script/module and execute it's run() method
        - run() method must receive a NetMagusSession object as only arg
        - run() method may return Form or (Form, anyobject)
     - receive a Form (and a state object) as a return from the user's
       run() method
     - store any state object and send JSON response back to NetMagus backend


     :meth:`._start` is used to initiate the execution of the user's code
     in the formula.

     The user's code can use various attributes and methods of this session
     object to interact with the NetMagus server and its UI.

     The following attributes exist within each session object:
     * :attr:`nm_input`:  holds the data entered by end-user on the NM ui
     * :attr:`user_state`: holds any state data from previous formula steps
