# Preprocess NLP Text

### Framework Description
A simple and fast framework for 
* Preprocessing or Cleaning of text
* Extracting top words or reduction of vocabulary 
* Feature Extraction
* Word Vectorization

Uses parallel execution by leveraging the [multiprocessing library](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html) in Python for cleaning of text, extracting top words and feature extraction modules. Contains both sequential and parallel ways (For less CPU intensive processes) for preprocessing text with an option of user-defined number of processes.

> *PS: There is no multi-processing support for word vectorization*

* `Cleaning Text` - Clean text with various defined stages implemented using standardized techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* `Vocab Reduction` - Find the top words in the corpus, lets you choose a threshold to consider the words that can stay in the corpus and replaces the others
* `Feature Extraction` - Extract features from corpus of text using SpaCy
* `Word Vectorization` - Simple code to convert words to vectors (TFIDF, Word2Vec, GloVe) using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)

#### Reduction of Vocabulary 
Shortlists top words based on the percentage as input. Replaces the words not shortlisted and replaces them efficienctly. Also, supports parallel and sequential processing. 



#### Feature Extraction Module

Various stages of feature extraction include:
| Stage                     | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| nouns                     | Extract the list of Nouns from the given string                                       |
| verbs                     | Extract the list of Verbs from the given string                                       |
| adjs                      | Extract the list of Adjectives from the given string                                  |
| noun_phrases              | Extract the list of Noun Phrases (Noun chunks) from the given string                  |
| keywords                  | Uses [YAKE](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake) for extracting keywords from text          |
| ner                       | Extracts Person, Location and Organization as named entities                          |
| numbers                   | Extracts all digits in the text                                                       |

#### Word Vectorization
Functions written in python to convert words to vectors using libraries like Scikit-Learn and Gensim. Contains four vectorization techniques like CountVectorizer (Bag of Words Model), TFIDF-Vectorizer, Word2Vec and GloVe. Also contains others features to get the top words according to IDF Scores, similar words with similarity scores and average sentence-wise vectors.

### Sequential & Parallel Processing
1. Sequential   - Processes records in a sequential order, does not consume a lot of CPU Memory but is slower compared to Parallel processing
2. Parallel     - Can create multiple processes (customizable/user-defined) to preprocess text parallelly, Memory intensive and faster
