Description: # Ion Detective
        
        This library provides functionalities to assist students to perform qualitative chemical analysis in Python.
        
        Usually, this analysis is performed in the wet lab, in which students are provided a sample probe that contains 
        a random composition of anions or cations, respectively. To determine the composition of their sample, students
        have to perform a variety of chemical detection reactions.
        
        This library tries to simulate this experience in a virtual, text-based way and contains real workflows for the
        reactions.
