Description: The vision of this project is to provide an easy, bulk transliteration service between Coptic and Latin script. The primary use case (Coptic --> Latin script) is to allow English speakers who do not read Coptic to follow along with church services by offering transliterated text with accurate and transparent pronunciations.
