Description: # BYASE
        
        A library that uses Bayesian inference to identify gene-level 
        and isoform-level ASE (Allele-specific expression) in polyploid 
        (diploid or higher) organisms from single-end or 
        paired-end RNA-seq data.
        
        ## Installation
        
        BYASE is released as a Python package and can be installed by:
        ```shell
        pip3 install --user byase
        ```
        BYASE will automatically install some package dependencies, 
        such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `pymc3`, `htseq` and 
        `pyarrow`. In order to avoid possible installation problems 
        on the server or cluster system, BYASE does not automatically 
        install the package `matplotlib`. 
        To use the **plotting module**, `matplotlib` should be 
        installed manually on the computer:
        ```shell
        pip3 install --user matplotlib
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The documentation of BYASE can be found 
        [here](https://byase-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
