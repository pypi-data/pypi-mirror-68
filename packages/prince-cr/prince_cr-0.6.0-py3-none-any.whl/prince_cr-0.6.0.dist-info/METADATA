# PriNCe - **Pr**opagation **i**ncluding **N**uclear **C**ascade **e**quations

This code solves the transport equation for ultra-high energy cosmic rays on cosmological scales.

## About this version

The package is numerically accurate for its current purpose (UHECR propagation). Since this the first public version, one should be cautious when deviating from the examples and check if the result makes sense, simply because so far only us (the devs) have been using it and the interfaces aren't sufficiently polished to be used *error-free* for tasks that we didn't foresee. Please file issues for anything strange, unclear, wrong, etc.. It will help us to debug the code and simplify the user interface.

## Installation

is as simple as 

```bash
pip install prince-cr
```

Check [the docs](https://prince.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details on the requirements. 

## [Documentation](https://prince.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The docs are hosted at [readthedocs](https://prince.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). They are still *incomplete* and we are working on improvements. Feedback/comments are welcome.
