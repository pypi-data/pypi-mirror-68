        # Features
        - Identifying Multiword Expressions (Collocations) in the corpus. Used for terminology and keyphrase extraction. Can lead to improvement in text classification. 
        - Identifying statistically redundant words for filtering. Usually leads to an improvement in document classification. 
        ## Upcoming Features
        - Anamoly Detection. 
        - Identifying non-compositional compouds: Can be used for tasks such as profanity/hate-speech detection, and linguistic analysis of a corpus.
