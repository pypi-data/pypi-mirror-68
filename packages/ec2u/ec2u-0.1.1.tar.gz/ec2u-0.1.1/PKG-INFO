Description: # EC2 Utils
        - Before you can begin using **ec2-utils**, you must set up authentication credentials. 
        If you have the AWS CLI installed, then you can use it to configure your credentials file:
        ```
        aws configure 
        ```
        Alternatively, you can create the credential file yourself. By default, its location is at `~/.aws/credentials`:
        ```
        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
        aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
        ```
        You may also want to set a default region. This can be done in the configuration file. By default, its location is at ~/.aws/config:
        ```
        [default]
        region=us-east-1
        ```
        
        This sets up credentials for the default profile as well as a default region to use when creating connections. 
        See [Credentials](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html#guide-configuration) for in-depth configuration sources and options.
