Compyrtment is a simple Python library to work with compartment models. It's 
a simple tool to aid with fast prototyping with models such as the SIR, SIS 
and SEIR epidemic models or the Lotka-Volterra model of predation. It supports:

- Designing models with arbitrary states and constant, linear and quadratic
  couplings between them;
- Numerical integration of the ODE system of a model;
- Numerical integration of 'sensitivity curves' - the gradient of each curve
  with respect to parameters as well as initial conditions;
- Fitting a model's parameters to existing data;
- Stochastic simulation using Gillespie's algorithm
