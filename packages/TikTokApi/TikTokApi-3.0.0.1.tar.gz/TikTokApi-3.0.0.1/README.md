## Quick Start Guide

Here's a quick bit of code to get the most recent trending on TikTok. There's more example in the examples directory.


```
from TikTokApi import TikTokApi
api = TikTokApi()

results = 10

trending = api.trending(results)

for tiktok in trending:
    # Prints the text of the tiktok
    print(tiktok['desc'])

print(len(trending))
```
[Here's](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/7c30780bbc30772ba11ec9e0b909e99d) an example of what a tiktok dictionary looks like.

## Detailed Documentation

##### The TikTok class

```
TikTokApi(self, debug=False)
```

debug - Enable this if you need some more output.


##### The Trending Method

```
# Where count is how many result you want
# Verbose is optional, default=0. Set it to 1 to get more information
api.trending(self, count=30, referrer="https://www.tiktok.com/@ondymikula/video/6756762109670477061")
```

count - this is how many trending Tiktoks you want to be returned.

Trending returns an array of dictionaries. Example structure [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@ondymikula/video/6756762109670477061)

##### The get_Video_By_Url Method

```
api.get_Video_By_Url(video_url, return_bytes=0)
```

video_url - The video you want to get url.

return_bytes - The default value is 0, when it is set to 1 the function instead returns the bytes from the video rather than just the direct url.
