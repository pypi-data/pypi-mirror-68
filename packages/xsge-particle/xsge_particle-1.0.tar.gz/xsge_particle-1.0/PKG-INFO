Description: xSGE is a collection of extensions for the SGE licensed under the GNU
        General Public License.  They are designed to give additional features
        to free/libre software games which aren't necessary, but are nice to
        have.
        
        xSGE extensions are not dependent on any particular SGE implementation.
        They should work with any implementation that follows the specification.
        
        This extension provides particle effects for the SGE.
