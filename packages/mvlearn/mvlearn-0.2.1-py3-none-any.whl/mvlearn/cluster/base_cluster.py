class BaseCluster(BaseEstimator):
    '''
    A base class for clustering multiview data.
    Parameters

    --------
    '''

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def fit(self, Xs):

        '''
        A method to fit clustering parameters to the multiview data.
        Parameters
        ----------
        Xs : list of array-likes or numpy.ndarray
            - Xs length: n_views
            - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)
            A list of different views to fit the model on.

        Returns
        -------
        self :  returns and instance of self.
        '''

        return self

    @abstractmethod
    def predict(self, Xs):

        '''
        A method to predict cluster labels of multiview data.
        Parameters
        ----------
        Xs : list of array-likes or numpy.ndarray
            - Xs length: n_views
            - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)
            A list of different views to cluster.

        Returns
        -------
        predictions : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            Returns the predicted cluster labels for each sample.
        '''
        return

    def fit_predict(self, Xs):

        '''
        Fit the cluster centroids to the data and then
        predict the cluster labels for the data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Xs : list of array-likes or numpy.ndarray
            - Xs length: n_views
            - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)
            This list must be of size 2, corresponding to the two views
            of the data. The two views can each have a different number
            of features, but they must have the same number of samples.

        Returns
        -------
        predictions : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            The predicted cluster labels for each sample.

        '''

        self.fit(Xs)
        predictions = self.predict(Xs)
        return predictions
