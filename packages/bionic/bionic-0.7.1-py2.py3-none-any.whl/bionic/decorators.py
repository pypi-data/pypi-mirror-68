def version(major=None, minor=None):
    """
    Identifies the version of a Python function.  The version has two
    components: a major version and a minor version.  Each of these can be
    either an integer or a string, and defaults to ``0``.

    When you change the implementation of an entity function, you should update
    its version so that Bionic knows to whether invalidate any cached values of
    that function and re-compute them.  An update in *major* version indicates
    a *functional* change: Bionic will assume that the function can return
    different output and won't use any cached artifacts created by a previous
    version of the function.  An update in *minor* version indicates a
    *nonfunctional* change, such as a refactoring or performance optimization:
    Bionic will assume that the function behaves the same for all inputs, and
    will continue using cached artifacts as long as the major version still
    matches.  Updating the minor version is only required when using Bionic's
    "assisted versioning" mode.

    You may also want to update the major version when there are changes in
    functions or libraries that the entity function calls, or in any external
    data source (like a database) that the function accesses.

    Parameters
    ----------

    major: Integer or string (default 0)
        An arbitrary identifier for a function's behavior.

    minor: Integer or string (default 0)
        An arbitrary identifier for a function's nonfunctional characteristics.

    -------
    Function:
        A decorator which can be applied to an entity function.

def changes_per_run(enabled=None):
    """
    Indicates whether this function is non-deterministic: i.e., if itâ€™s called multiple
    times with the same inputs, can it return different outputs?

    When ``enabled`` is true, Bionic will recompute this function's value (and
    potentially the values of anything depending on it) each time this flow is
    instantiated, rather than reusing a value cached on disk. For example, if the
    function queries data from an external database, the results may be different each
    time even if the query stays the same.

    However, for practical reasons, Bionic won't compute a new value more than once
    within a single run. That is, once it's been computed for a particular Flow
    instance, that value will be saved in memory and reused. This is a compromise:
    logically it makes sense to recompute it every time, but it's much simpler to have
    a single fixed value for each entity within a given flow instance. For this reason,
    when this decorator is enabled, memoization must not be disabled for this entity.

    Note that ``@changes_per_run`` is not the same as ``@persist(False)``. For example,
    the following code will not necessarily query the database each time:

    .. code-block:: python

        @builder
        @bn.persist(False)
        @builder
        def current_data():
            return download_data()

        @builder
        def summary(current_data):
            return summarize(current_data)

    This fails because if we call ``flow.get('summary')`` and Bionic finds a cached
    value, it will return the cached value because it doesn't know that current_data
    ought to be recomputed. On the other hand, if we replace ``persist(False)`` with
    ``changes_per_run`` -- as in the example below -- then ``current_data`` will be
    recomputed each time (and ``summary`` will be recomputed if ``current_data``
    changes).

    Parameters
    ----------

    enabled: Boolean, optional (default ``True``)
        Whether this function's output changes per run.

    Returns
    -------
    Function:
        A decorator which can be applied to an entity function.
