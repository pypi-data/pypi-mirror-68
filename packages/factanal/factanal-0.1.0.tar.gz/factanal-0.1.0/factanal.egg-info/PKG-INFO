Description: ### Factanalpy
        
        Python wrapper replicating the known factor analysis output from factanal R function. 
        The only supported input is a pandas data frame. Formulas as input are currently 
        not supported. A covariance matrix is always computed from the input data frame. 
        Setting control variables for maximum likelihood estimation is currently not 
        supported.
