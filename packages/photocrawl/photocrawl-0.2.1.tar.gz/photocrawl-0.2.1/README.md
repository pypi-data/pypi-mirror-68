A simple script to run analysis and get insight on my use of equipment and settings in my practice of photography.

This script runs on Python3.6.1+, and requires the following libraries: [`PyExifInfo`][pyexifinfo], `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas` and `loguru`.
Most importantly, it also requires that you have the amazing [ExifTool][exiftool] package by Phil Harvey.

### Install

This code is compatible with `Python 3.6+`.
If for some reason you have a need for it, you can simply install it in your virtual enrivonment with:
```bash
pip install photocrawl
```

## Usage

With this package is installed in the activated enrivonment, usage is:
```bash
python -m photocrawl -i files_location
```

Detailed options go as follows:
```bash
usage: __main__.py [-h] -i IMAGES_LOCATION [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
                   [--show-figures SHOW_FIGURES] [--save-figures SAVE_FIGURES]
                   [-l LOG_LEVEL]

Python 3.6+ utility to get insight on your photography practice.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IMAGES_LOCATION, --images IMAGES_LOCATION
                        Location, either relative or absolute, of the
                        directory with images you wish to crawl
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output OUTPUT_DIR
                        Location, either relative or absolute, of the output
                        directory.Defaults to 'outputs'
  --show-figures SHOW_FIGURES
                        Whether or not to show figures when plotting insights.
  --save-figures SAVE_FIGURES
                        Whether or not to save figures when plotting insights.
  -l LOG_LEVEL, --logs LOG_LEVEL
                        The base console logging level. Can be 'debug',
                        'info', 'warning' and 'error'.Defaults to 'info'.

## TODO

- [x] Handling raw files.
- [x] Handling subfolders when looking for files.
- [x] Output all insight in a single/two plot.
- [x] Implement proper logging.
- [x] Make into a package
- [x] Make callable as a python module (`python -m photocrawl ...`)
