    Carbon DLS API

    Welcome to the Carbon DLS API docs!  A Carbon DLS API token ([JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)) must be included with each request to the API.  Steps to create API tokens: - Create and download an API key [here](https://print.carbon3d.com/api_keys) - For testing: Generate JWT tokens using the [token generator](/token_generator) - For production: Generate JWT tokens dynamically (<em>see authtoken-create.py example</em>) - A valid Carbon API token must be included as <code>Authorization: Bearer [token]</code> HTTP header.  This API provides a programmatic interface for submitting part (and soon build) orders. The general process for creating an order is as follows:  - Upload model files to the API with the [/models](#/Models) endpoint - Create parts that reference a model and a part number with the [/parts](#/Parts) endpoint   -  Part numbers can be created [here](https://print.carbon3d.com/catalog_parts) - Create an order with the [/orders](#/Orders) endpoint  Uploaded models, parts and orders can be retrieved either in bulk or by UUID at the [/models](#/Models), [/parts](#/Parts) and [/orders](#/Orders) endpoints, respectively.  Once a part order is submitted, automatic packing will create one or more builds (for mass-customization applications only).  Builds can be retrieved either in bulk or by UUID at the [/builds](#/Builds) endpoint. - Build attachments (traveler, slice video) can be retrieved by UUID at the [/attachments](#/Attachments) endpoint.  This API also provides a programmatic interface to access [printer](#/Printers) (fleet) status and query for [prints](#/Prints).   # noqa: E501
