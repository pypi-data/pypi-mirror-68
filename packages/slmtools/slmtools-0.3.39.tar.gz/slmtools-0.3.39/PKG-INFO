        ## Installation
        
        To install `slm` in Windows, follow the steps below.
        
        - You should first install the following software requirements:
            - [Anaconda for Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download). This includes
              Python as well as some necessary scientific libraries.
            - [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). This is necessary for the
              automatic version numbering of this package. Also, make sure you choose
              *Git from the command line and also 3rd-party software* in *Adjusting
              your PATH environment*.
        - *Clone* this repository using Git. From any folder in File Explorer,
          right-click and hit *Git Bash here*. Paste `git clone
          https://github.com/jacopoantonello/slm` and hit enter. Do not use GitHub's
          *Download ZIP* button above, as the installation script will not work in that
          case.
        - Finally, double-click on `install.bat`.
        
        To run the GUI, double-click on `run.bat`.
