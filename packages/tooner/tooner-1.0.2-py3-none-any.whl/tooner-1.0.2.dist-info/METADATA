An easier way to manage and launch sessions for multiple toons for [Toontown Rewritten](https://toontownrewritten.com).

# What does it do?

Currently, it allows you to communicate with Toontown Rewritten's login API in order to log in and start a session with very few lines of code.

```
launcher = multitooner.ToontownLauncher(directory="TTREngine.exe")
launcher.play(username="username", password="password")
```

If you're crazy, you can even combine these lines into one!

The best part is that you can do this to **play multiple toons at once**.

# Why does this exist?

Since I normally play on MacOS, there is no way for me to open multiple sessions of the Toontown Rewritten launcher without doing it from the terminal; this was really annoying to do every time I wanted to multitoon (which is a lot), so I set out to make this easier.

Ultimately, I was successful in making this functionality work the three major operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and, I assume, on Linux (I haven't been able to test this).

# Taking it further

I have a few project ideas that could use this functionality:
- Make a menu bar app for MacOS
- Make a GUI to allow the user to store login information and start sessions for multiple toons
- Refactor the launcher module to allow for better communication with the GUI
- Send toast notifications for invasions
- If multitooning, tile windows automatically
However, they would be separate projects.
