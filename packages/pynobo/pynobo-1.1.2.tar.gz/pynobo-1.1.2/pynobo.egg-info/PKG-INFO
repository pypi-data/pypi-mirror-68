Description: # Nobø Hub / Nobø Energy Control Websocket Interface
        
        This system/service/software is not officially supported or endorsed by Glen Dimplex Nordic AS, and the authors/maintainer(s) are not official partner of Glen Dimplex Nordic AS
        
        [The API (v1.1) for Nobø Hub can be found here][api]
        
        [api]: https://www.glendimplex.no/media/15650/nobo-hub-api-v-1-1-integration-for-advanced-users.pdf
        
        ## Quick Start
        
            from pynobo import nobo
        
        Either call using the three last digits in the hub serial
            
            glen = nobo('123') 
        
        or full serial and IP if you do not want to discover on UDP:
        
            glen = nobo('123123123123', '10.0.0.128', False)
        
        after that you can start playing around using the different dictionaries that should be loaded with whatever the hub gave you:
        
            glen.hub_info
            glen.zones
            glen.components
            glen.week_profiles
            glen.overrides
            glen.temperatures
        
        ## Available functionality
        
        
        * nobo class - When called it will initialize logger and dictionaries, connect to hub and start daemon thread
        
        * nobo.API class - All the commands and responses from API v1.1, Some with sensible names, others not yet given better names 
        
        
        ### Background Functions
        
        These functions run in the background after initialization of the nobo class
        
        * connect_hub - Attempt initial connection and handshake
        * discover_hubs - Attempts to autodiscover Nobø Ecohubs on the local networkself
        * reconnect_hub - Attempt to disconnect/close the connection and reconnect
         
        * socket_receive - The task running in daemon thread for receiving and handling responses from the hub
        * get_response - Get a response string from the hub and reformat string list before returning it
        * response_handler - Handle the response(s) from the hub and updated the dictionaries accordingly
        
        ### Command Functions
        
        These functions sends commands to the hub
        
        * send_command - Send a list of command string(s) to the hub
        * create_override - Override hub/zones/components
        * update_zone - Update the name, week profile, temperature or override allowing for a zone.  
        
        ### Dictionary helper functions
        
        These functions simplifies getting the data you want from the dictionaries
        
        * get_week_profile_status - Get the status of a week profile at a certain time in the week 
        * get_current_zone_mode - Get the mode of a zone at a certain time
        * get_current_component_temperature - Get the current temperature from a component
        * get_current_zone_temperature - Get the current temperature from (the first component in) a zone
