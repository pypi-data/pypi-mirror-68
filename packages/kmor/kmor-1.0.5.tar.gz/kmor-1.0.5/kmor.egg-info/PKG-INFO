Description: # KMOR Numpy
        
        The python implementation for k-means clustering with outlier removal from the paper written by Guojun Gan et al. [[1]](#1)
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install kmor
        ```
        
        You can also install by conda
        
        ```
        conda install -c ksunhokim kmor
        ```
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        from kmor import kmor
        X = np.array([
            [1,0,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,0,1],
            [0,0,100]
        ])
        U = kmor(X, 1)
        print(U) # [0,0,0,1]
        ```
        
        The outliers are assigned to the extra cluster k.
