SHELL COMPLETION
================

To enable completion, perform the following command:

```
vsd --completion
```

Then copy and paste this snippet in your shell.
This will temporarily enable completion until you close your shell.

To keep completion active across reboot, run:


 - For Bash:
```
vsd --completion >> ~/.bashrc
```

 - For Zsh:
```
vsd --completion >> ~/.zshrc
```

 - For Fish:
```
vsd --completion >> ~/.config/fish/completions/vsd.fish
```
