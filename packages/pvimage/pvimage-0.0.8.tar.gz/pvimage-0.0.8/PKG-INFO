        The process by which Electroluminescent images of photovoltaic modules are captured leads to variation in module orientation between images. To ensure the images are uniformly oriented and registered for analysis, we created an image processing pipeline, which has been discussed in our previous work [1,2,3,4]. Filtering and thresholding methods are used to initially preprocess the data to remove barrel distortion, reduce noise, and remove unimportant background data. With a noise-reduced image, a convex hull algorithm is used to identify cell areas and mark them as a “1” (white pixel) while every other pixel is assigned a “0” (black pixel). A series of 1-D x-axis and y-axis parallel slices are taken through the binary array to identify the steps up (0 to 1) and steps down (1 to 0) across the slice. These steps correspond to the module edge. A regression model is fit to the points along the module edge, and the intersections of the edge lines identify the corners of the PV module. A perspective transformation is, then, applied to uniformly orient and planarize the module image resulting in the final planar-indexed module image ready for subsequent analysis.
