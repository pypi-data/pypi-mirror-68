Description: # Visualize Makefile Dependency Graphs
        
        `makefile2dot` produces a Graphviz `dot` graph from a Makefile. To run it,
        install `graphviz` and `python`. This version runs on python 3.
        
        ```bash
            sudo apt-get install graphviz python
        	pip install makefile2dot
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        `makefile2dot` reads the `Makefile` in the current working directory using the
        same lookup rules that `make` does (it actually uses `make` to parse the
        `Makefile`). By default, it writes the resulting `dot` graph to `stdout`, which
        can be read in by `graphviz`. So a nice trick is to pipe output from
        `makefile2dot` directly in to `dot`.
        
        For example:
        
        ````bash
            makefile2dot | dot -Tpng > out.png
        ````
        
        If you just want to see the graph without saving it, you can provide the
        `--view` flag:
        
        ````bash
        	makefile2dot -v
        ````
        
        You can select the graph orientation so that it is drawn from top to bottom
        (`TB`), bottom to top (`BT`), left to right (`LR`) or right to left (`RL`). For
        example:
        
        ````bash
        	makefile2dot -v --direction LR
        ````
        
        draws the graph from left to right, rather than the default bottom to top.
        
        Normal targets are drawn as rectangles, and `.PHONY` targets are drawn as
        circles.
        
        ## Tips
        
        To test this project in the source directory, add the source directory to the
        python path:
        
        ````bash
        $ export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
        ````
