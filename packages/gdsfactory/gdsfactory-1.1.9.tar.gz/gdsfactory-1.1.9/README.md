# GDS factory 1.1.9

Python package to generate GDS layouts.

GDSII is the standard format to create masks sets in the CMOS industry.

This package adds some extra functionalities to [phidl](https://github.com/amccaugh/phidl):

- define components by netlist
- define component sweeps (Design of Experiments) in YAML files
- define templates for basic components
- route optical/electrical ports

# Documentation

[read Documentation](https://gdsfactory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

# Installation

If you are on Windows, you need to install a C++ compiler ["Build Tools for Visual Studio"](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017)

Once you have `git` and `python3` we recommend to install the latest version from the git repo by copy-pasting this 3 lines into a terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory.git
cd gdsfactory
bash install.sh
```

`pf` builds, tests, and configures masks and components from the command line. Just type `pf` in a terminal.

```
Commands:
  build    Commands for building masks
  config   Work with pdk.CONFIG
  drc      Run DRC
  log      Work with logs
  show     Show a GDS file in Klayout using KLive
