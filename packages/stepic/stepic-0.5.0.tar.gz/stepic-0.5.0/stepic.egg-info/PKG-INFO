        # INTRODUCTION
        
        Stepic hides arbitrary data inside Pillow images.
        
        Stepic is a Python module and command line tool for hiding arbitrary data
        within images by slightly modifying the colors. These modifications are
        generally imperceptible to humans, but are machine detectable.  Works with
        RGB, RGBA, or CMYK images. Does not work with JPEG or other lossy compression
        schemes.
