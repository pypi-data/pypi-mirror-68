Version: 0.1.0
Summary: This is a collection of data science functions that I have found extremely useful across a wide variety of use cases. This is mostly a library just for me, but feel free to use it if you want. This is a library that handles tabular data mostly. This specific version takes a lot of deprecated functions from fastai0.7 and mainly pulls from their random forest lessons. I will be continuously adding to this lib as I learn more data science things
