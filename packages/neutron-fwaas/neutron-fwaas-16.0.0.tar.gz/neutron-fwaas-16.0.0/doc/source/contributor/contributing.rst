=============================

If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack, you must
follow the steps documented at:
https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack should be submitted
for review via the Gerrit tool, following the workflow documented at:
https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad in the 'neutron' project:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron

To get in touch with the neutron-fwaas community,
look at the following resources:

- Join the #openstack-fwaas IRC channel on Freenode.  This is where the
  FireWall-as-a-Service team is available for discussion.
- Join the `FireWall-as-a-Service weekly IRC meeting
  <http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/#Firewall_as_a_Service_(FWaaS)_Team_Meeting>`_
  where the status of new initiatives and bugs is discussed.
