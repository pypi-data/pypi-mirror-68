    Coexistence between security group and firewall group.
features:
  - L2 firewall group driver based OVS can work in coexistence mode.
    That means, if a port is associated with both firewall group and
    security group, then a packet must be allowed by both features.
other:
  - If a port is associated with both firewall group & security group and
    there is a security group logging, which is enabled to collect ``DROP``
    events for this port, then most of invalid packets will be dropped at
    firewall group for performance reason except first dropped packet, which
    is allowed by firewall group but not accepted by security group. So not
    every dropped packet will be logged (like in case of security group
    works in standalone mode).
