    Resource type **firewall group** has been supported for neutron packet
    logging framework.  You can specify firewall group as ``--resource-type``
    for logging API.
features:
  - |
    Enable to collect network packet log for ACCEPT/DROP action from firewall
    groups. Currently, packet logging supports only L3(router) ports.
issues:
  - |
    [`bug 1720727 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1720727>`__]
    Currently, we cannot specify the following combination on CLI due to
    missing validation of --resource-type:

        - --resource-type firewall_group --resource <ID of firewall group>
        - --resource-type firewall_group --resource <ID of firewall group> --target <ID of port>

    Therefore, you can only run with following combinations:

        - --resource-type firewall_group --target <ID of port>
        - --resource-type firewall_group
