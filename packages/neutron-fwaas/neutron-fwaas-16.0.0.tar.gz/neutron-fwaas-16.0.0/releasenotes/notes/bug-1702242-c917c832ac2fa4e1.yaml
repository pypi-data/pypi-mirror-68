    [`bug 1702242 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1702242>`__]
    Port range specification of a firewall rule now works expectedly
    with the reference L3 agent based implementation.
    Previously, when creating a firewall rule with port range like
    ``8778:9000``, the rule was not deleted correctly and only entries
    associated with the first port number were clean up.
    Note that this bug is only applied to the reference L3 agent
    based implementation.
