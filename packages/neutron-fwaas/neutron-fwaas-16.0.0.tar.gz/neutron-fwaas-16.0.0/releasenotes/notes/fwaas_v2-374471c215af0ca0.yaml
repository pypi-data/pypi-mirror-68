  The FWaaS team is pleased to release FWaaS v2.0.  This release of FWaaS
  supports either the original FWaaS v1 or the new FWaaS v2.
features:
  - In FWaaS v2 firewall policies are applied to router ports, as opposed to
    applying to routers in FWaaS v1.
  - Earlier the FWaaS agent integrated with the L3 agent by having the L3 Agent
    class inherit from the FWaaS Agent class. This meant that other service
    agents could not also integrate with the L3 agent.  Now, using the L3 agent
    extensions mechanism, FWaaS (v1 and v2) plugs in to the L3 agent.  This
    means that it can interoperate peacefully with other L3 advanced services
    that also implement the L3 agent extension mechanism, all without any code
    changes to Neutron.
upgrade:
  - There is not currently a defined upgrade path from FWaaS v1 to FWaaS v2.
  - FWaaS v1 can not be enabled at the same time as FWaaS v2; one or the other
    must be chosen.
