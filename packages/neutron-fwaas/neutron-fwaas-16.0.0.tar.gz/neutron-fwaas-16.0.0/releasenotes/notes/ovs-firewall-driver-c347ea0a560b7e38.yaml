    Currently, the FWaaSv2 L2 driver can be configured as:

        ``firewall_driver = ovs``

    And the Security Group driver is specified as:

        ``firewall_driver = openvswitch``

    If both are configured, the packet will still only hit the FWaaS table in
    OVS and will not traverse the rules in the SG table. There are some fixes
    needed to support this model which are being tested and will be merged
    shortly. Currently there are no checks to allow only one of FWaaS L2 or SG
    to be configured.
