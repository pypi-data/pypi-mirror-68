prelude: >
    Enable quotas for FWaaS.
features:
  - The FWaaS extension will register quotas.
    The default values for quota_firewall and
    quota_firewall_policy are set to 10.
    The default value for quota_firewall_rule
    is set to 100.
    Quotas can be adjusted in the conf files, including
    -1 values to allow unlimited.
issues:
  - Tenants may receive a 409 Conflict error with a
    message body containing a quota exceeded message
    during resource creation if their quota is exceeded.
other:
  - Operators that increase the default limit for quota_routers
    from 10 may want to bump FWaaS quotas as well, since with
    router insertion a tenant can potentially have a unique
    policy and firewall for each router.
