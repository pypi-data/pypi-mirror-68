Summary: 
        Phosphorpy is python package to mine large photometric sky surveys.
        It is designed to allow to do common and regular task, which are done if
        large photometric data sets are used, in just few lines.
        The aim is to provide a simple interface to make such data sets and
        specially data set combination more accessible to the community.        
        These task are for example, cross-match different catalogs (photometric and
        astrometric), make basic selection, plotting results, simple image and/or
        light curves downloads.

# Phosphorpy
**Phosphorpy** is python package to mine large photometric sky surveys. 
It is designed to allow to do common and regular task, which are done if
large photometric data sets are used, in just few lines. 
The aim is to provide a simple interface to make such data sets and 
specially data set combination more accessible to the community.

These task are for example, cross-match different catalogs (photometric and 
astrometric), make basic selection, plotting results, simple image and/or
light curves downloads.

All accessible data are publicly available and for the references, see the
[survey config file](https://gitlab.sron.nl/asg/jonker/Phosphorpy/blob/master/Phosphorpy/local/survey.conf).
This file includes the references to the corresponding publications.

Details are on the [wiki page](https://gitlab.sron.nl/patrickr/Phosphorpy/wikis/home)

## Installation
**Phosphorpy** is available via [Pypi](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed with pip
```
pip install Phosphorpy
```

## Requirements
**Phosphorpy** uses plenty of other packages to perform the queries, downloads
and do the calculations.

* astropy
* astroquery
* matplotlib
* numpy
* numba
* pandas
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* scipy
* urllib
* [armapy](https://github.com/patrickRauer/armapy)
* holoviews (optional)


## Example
See [example](https://gitlab.sron.nl/patrickr/Phosphorpy/wikis/Example) for
an extended example, which includes the main functionalities of **Phosphorpy**.
