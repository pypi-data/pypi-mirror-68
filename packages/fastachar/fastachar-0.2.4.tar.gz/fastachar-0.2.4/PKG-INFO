Description: 
        Fastachar
        =========
        
        **Fastachar** is a graphical user interface that allows a simple
        comparison of two sets of DNA sequences. A typical working example
        is to have a selection of DNA sequences of different, but related
        species. These sequences are divided in a set A, which are thought
        to be a single taxon (species) and a set B, which is a collection of
        different taxa. Using the program, it can be established easily whether:
        
        * the DNA sequences in set A are all identical, and if not, list the
          differences for those positions in the DNA sequences.
        
        * set B has positions in the DNA that are different from those in
          set A,  across **all** species in set B.
        
        **Fastachar** takes as input the alignments stored in a single file of
        the fasta format. **Fastachar** is not a tool to align sequences. It is
        assumed that the sequences were previously aligned with different algorithms 
        (e.g. MUSCLE) and the most reliable alignment was chosen.
