Description: # Keebsound
        
        Keebsound is a package that I built to generate realistic keyboard tap sounds. You can provide a string and it will "type" those characters out, providing ASMR goodness. 
        It also supports hooking into the keyboard and replacing your keytap sound with whichever key switch profile you desire. 
        
        ## Getting Started

        ### Prerequisites
        
        What things you need to install the software and how to install them
        
        ```
        Give examples
        ```
        
        ### Installing

        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        Options:
          --hook           This hooks into your keyboard and plays a sound when you
                           type
        
          --switches TEXT  Provide the sound profile, by default it's set to gateron-
                           red
        
          --delay FLOAT    Sound delay multiplier for playing keyboard sound from a
                           string
        
          --string TEXT    Pass some arbitrary string to play a keyboard typing sound
                           typing said string
        
          --help           Show this message and exit.
        ```
        
        ### Playing the sound of a string
        
        `python main.py --string "Foo bar is not enough. What are you up to?" --delay 3`
        
        ### Hooking to the keyboard
        
        `python main.py --hook`
        
        You can now start typing and it will generate sounds for you. 
        
        ### Using explicit key switch sounds
        
        `python main.py --string "Foo bar is not enough. What are you up to?" --switches gateron-red`
