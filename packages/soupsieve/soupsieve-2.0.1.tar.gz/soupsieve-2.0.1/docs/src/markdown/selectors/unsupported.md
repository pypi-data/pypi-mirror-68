# Non-Applicable Pseudo Classes

## Overview

These pseudo classes are recognized by the parser, and have been identified as not being applicable in a Beautiful Soup
environment. While the pseudo-classes will parse correctly, they will not match anything. This is because they cannot be
implemented outside a live, browser environment. If at any time these are dropped from the CSS spec, they will simply
be removed.

## `:active`<span class="html5 badge"></span> {:#:active}

Selects active elements.

=== "Syntax"

    :active
    ```

## `:current`<span class="html5 badge"></span><span class="lab badge"></span> {:#:current}

`:current` selects the element, or an ancestor of the element, that is currently being displayed. The functional form of
`:current()` takes a compound selector list.

    ```css
    :current
    :current(selector1, selector2)
    ```

## `:focus`<span class="html5 badge"></span> {:#:focus}

    ```

## `:focus-visible`<span class="html5 badge"></span><span class="lab badge"></span> {:#:focus-visible}

Selects an element that matches `:focus` and the user agent determines that the focus should be made evident on the
element.

## `:host`<span class="html5 badge"></span><span class="lab badge"></span> {:#host}

`:host` selects the element hosting a shadow tree. While the function form of `:host()` takes a complex selector list
and matches the shadow host only if it matches one of the selectors in the list.

=== "Syntax"
    ```css
    :host
    :host(selector1, selector2)
    ```

## `:host-context()`<span class="html5 badge"></span><span class="lab badge"></span> {:#:host-context}

list.
