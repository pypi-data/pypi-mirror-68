Description: # ALMa - An Active Leanring (data) Manager
        
        ALMa elimiates the need for bookkeeping when using Active Learning. Read the blog post
        on [Active Learning with ALMa](https://www.lighttag.io/blog/active-learning-manager/)
         
        Made with heart by LightTag - The Text Annotation Tool For Teams. 
        We use ALMa to facilitate multi annotator active learning. Originally developed as a contribution for [Modal](https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL)
         but moved to it's own library 
        
        
        ## Install
        ```
        pip install ALMa
        ```
        
        ## Use
        Check out the full [example for text classification]('./examples/text_text_classification_with_modAL')
         
        ```python
        from ALMa import ActiveLearningManager
        manager = ActiveLearningManager(my_featurized_data, sources=optional_original_data)
        learner = #...some active learning learner
        for index in range(N_QUERIES):
            index_to_label, query_instance = learner.query(manager.unlabeld)
            original_ix = manager.get_original_index_from_unlabeled_index(index_to_label)
            y = original_labels_train[original_ix]
            label = (index_to_label, y)
            manager.add_labels(labels)
            learner.teach(X=manager.labeled, y=manager.labels)
        
        ```
