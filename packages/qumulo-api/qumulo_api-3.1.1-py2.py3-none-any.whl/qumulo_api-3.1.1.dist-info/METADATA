Qumulo API Tools
================

This directory contains a collection of tools and libraries that will help
the user interact with the Qumulo REST API server.

It includes the following:

  - ``qumulo/``: a directory of libraries that can be used to interact with the
    REST API server
  - ``qq``: a comprehensive tool that implements the libraries in ``qumulo/``
    and provides for typical Qumulo CLI control functionality

Using qq
========

To see all commands available from the ``qq`` tool::

    $ ./qq --help

To run commands against the REST API server, you must first login::

    $ ./qq --host host_ip login --user admin

Once authenticated, you can run other commands::

    # Get the network configuation of nodes in the cluster:
    $ ./qq --host host_ip network_poll

    # Get the list of users
    $ ./qq --host host_ip auth_list_users

    # Get help with a specific command
    $ ./qq command --help

Notes
=====

These tools require Python 2.7; they will not run under Python 3.
