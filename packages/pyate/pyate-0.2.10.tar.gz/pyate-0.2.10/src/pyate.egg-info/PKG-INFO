        [![Built with spaCy](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with%20❤%20and-spaCy-09a3d5.svg)](https://spacy.io)
        
        Python implementation of term extraction algorithms such as C-Value, Basic, Combo Basic, Weirdness and Term Extractor using Spacy POS tagging.
        
        ## Installation
        Using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pyate https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-2.2.5/en_core_web_sm-2.2.5.tar.gz
        ```
        
        ## Quickstart
        ```python3
        from pyate import combo_basic

        string = """Central to the development of cancer are genetic changes that endow these “cancer cells” with many of the
        hallmarks of cancer, such as self-sufficient growth and resistance to anti-growth and pro-death signals. However, while the
        genetic changes that occur within cancer cells themselves, such as activated oncogenes or dysfunctional tumor suppressors,
        are responsible for many aspects of cancer development, they are not sufficient. Tumor promotion and progression are
        dependent on ancillary processes provided by cells of the tumor environment but that are not necessarily cancerous 
        themselves. Inflammation has long been associated with the development of cancer. This review will discuss the reflexive 
        relationship between cancer and inflammation with particular focus on how considering the role of inflammation in physiologic 
        processes such as the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair may provide a logical framework for understanding the 
        connection between the inflammatory response and cancer."""

        ## Summary of functions 
        Each of ```c_value, basic, combo_basic, weirdness``` and ```term_extractor``` take in a string, list or Pandas Series and outputs a Pandas Series of term-value pairs, where higher values indicate higher chance of being a domain specific term.
