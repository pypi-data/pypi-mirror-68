Description: # eanalytics_api_py
        
        A python 3 module to retrieve data from Eulerian Technologies API
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        Having a python 3 environment
        
        ## Installing
        
        ```
        pip install eanalytics_api_py
        ```
        
        ## Running
        
        ```
        from eanalytics_api_py.datamining import download
        path2file = download(
                        gridpool_name = grid,
                        datacenter = datacenter,
                        website_name = website,
                        api_key = key,
                        datamining_type = type
                        payload = {},
        )
        ```
        
        ## Notes
        
        - Use this doc to customize your payload object: https://doc.api.eulerian.com/#tag/Datamining:-goals%2Fpaths%2F~1ea~1%7Bsite%7D~1report~1actionlog~1search.json%2Fget
        - The file downloaded is gzipped
        - Explore your data using jupyter-notebook along with pandas and seaborn for plug'n'play data cleaning/visualisation
