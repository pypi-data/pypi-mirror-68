class measure:
    """
    A class used to measure time elapsed. Use for example like this:

    >>> with measure() as measurement:
    >>>     time.sleep(1)
    >>>     print('This has taken so far', measurement(), 'seconds')
    >>>     time.sleep(1)
    >>> print('A total of ', measurement(), 'seconds have elapsed')

    You can also use the .start() method instead of context manager. Time measurement
    will stop after exiting or calling .stop() depending on stop_on_stop flag.

    You can also decorate your functions to have them keep track time of their execution, like that:

    >>> @measure()
    >>> def measuring(measurement_object: measure, *args, **kwargs):
    >>>     ...

    You can also measure how long does executing a future take, eg.

    >>> future = get_my_future()
    >>> measurement = measure(future)
    >>> future.result()
    >>> print('Executing the future took', measurement(), 'seconds')

    In case a future is passed, the measurement will stop automatically as soon as the future
    returns with a result (or exception)
