        # cmcrameri
        
        This is a basic Python wrapper around Fabio Crameri's perceptually uniform colour maps
        
        http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php
        
        All credit for creating the colourmaps to Fabio. Any errors in the Python implementation of said colourmaps are my own.
        
        Current version is based on Scientific Colourmaps Version 6.0.4 (06.01.2020)
        
        **Work in progress** Not ready for public use yet! I haven't shipped a package before. The eventual aim is for this repo to serve PyPi and conda
        
        ### Install
        `pip install cmcrameri`
        
        ### Basic use example
        
        ```python
        from cmcrameri import cm
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        x = np.linspace(0, 100, 100)[None, :]  
        plt.imshow(x, aspect='auto', cmap=cm.batlow) # or any of the other colourmaps made by Fabio Crameri
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.show()
        ```
        ### Extra instructions
        You can access all the core colourmaps from Fabio Crameri's list by `cm.<colormapname>`
        
        You can also use tab autocompletion on `cm` if your editor supports it
        
        For a reversed colourmap, append `_r` to the colourmap name
        
        For a sample of all the available colourmaps without leaving the comfort of your Python session
        ```python
        from cmcrameri.cm import show_cmaps 
        show_cmaps()
        ```
