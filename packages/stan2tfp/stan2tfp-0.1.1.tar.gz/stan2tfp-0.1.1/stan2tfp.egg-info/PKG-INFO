Description: # Stan2tfp
        
        ![](https://github.com/adamhaber/stan2tfp/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
        
        The new [Stan compiler](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3) features a TensorFlow Probability backend, transpiling Stan programs to python code. 
        
        stan2tfp is a lightweight interface wrapper around this functionality, allowing users to:
        
        * call the compiler (emitting TFP code)
        * run the code (creating a model object in the current namespace)
        * sample the model (using TFP's NUTS)
        
        ... without leaving the notebook or their favorite IDE.
        
        The new compiler and the TFP backend are under active development. Currently only a small subset of Stan's functionality is supported. For a list of supported distributions, see [here](https://github.com/adamhaber/stan2tfp/blob/master/distributions.md).
        
        ## Install
        
        stan2tfp is a pure-Python package which can be installed from PyPI
        
        ```
        pip install stan2tfp
        ```
        
        This will also install TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability (both in nightly version; needed for XLA compilation of the model). 
        
        stan2tfp provides the function `download_stan2tfp_compiler` which downloads a pre-compiled binary of the compiler. By default it installs the latest version into the same directory as the package itself. A different path or a different version of the compiler can be specified.
        
        ## "Hello world"
        
        For a simple end-to-end example of using stan2tfp, see [here](https://github.com/adamhaber/stan2tfp/blob/master/examples/eight%20schools%20example.ipynb).
