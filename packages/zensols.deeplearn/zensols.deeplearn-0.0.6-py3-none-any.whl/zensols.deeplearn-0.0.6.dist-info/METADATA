# General deep learning tools with PyTorch

[![PyPI][pypi-badge]][pypi-link]
[![Python 3.7][python37-badge]][python37-link]

General deep learing utility library.  It contains a utilities I used in my own
research that have some intersection with:
* Convolution layer dimensionality calculation
* [PyTorch] convolution factory
* Unrelated (to deep learning) plotting utilities.

Much of the code provides convenience functionality to [PyTorch].  However,
there is functionality that could be used for other deep learning APIs.


## Obtaining

The easist way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip3 install zensols.deeplearn
```

Binaries are also available on [pypi].


## Changelog

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).
