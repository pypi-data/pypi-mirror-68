#### Docs

First thing you must do is call the `neo4jupyter.init_notebook_mode()` to load all the javascript.

```python
import neo4jupyter
neo4jupyter.init_notebook_mode()
```

Drawing a graph it's as easy as giving the funcion `neo4jupyter.draw()` the [py2neo](http://py2neo.org/v3/) graph object and the parameters that you want to be displayed. An example of the settings for the [movie graph tutorial](https://neo4j.com/developer/example-project/), `options = {"Movie": "title", "Person": "name"}` will show the nodes `Person` and `Movie` by title and name consecutively and their connexions.

```python
neo4jupyter.draw(graph_object_py2neo, {"Nodes_type": "Att", â€¦})
```

I encourage you to read the [neo4jupyter.py](https://github.com/merqurio/neo4jupyter/blob/master/neo4jupyter.py) file, is small and subject to be enhanced.
