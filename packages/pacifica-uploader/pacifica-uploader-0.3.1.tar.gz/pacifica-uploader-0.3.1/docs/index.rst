Welcome to Pacifica Python Uploader's documentation!
====================================================

Pacifica Python Uploader, `pacifica-uploader`, is a Python programming language
library for managing, serializing and transporting (over a network) archives of
files (referred to as "bundles"), managing both the data and the metadata of the
bundle, and interacting with
`Pacifica Ingest <https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica-ingest>`_ and
`Pacifica Policy <https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica-policy>`_ servers.
