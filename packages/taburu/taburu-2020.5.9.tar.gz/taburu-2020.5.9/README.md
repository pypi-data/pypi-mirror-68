taburu (after テーブル) is a module for using hashed arrays as parameter tables
developed by the 
[Toyota Research Institute's AMDD division](http://www.tri.global/accelerated-materials-design-and-discovery/).

It's primary purpose is to use event sourcing and hashed parameter tables
to ensure that prior methods can be accounted for when doing new experiments.
