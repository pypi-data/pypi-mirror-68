        Webpack integration for Flask.
        
        Flask-WebpackExt makes it easy to interface with your existing Webpack project
        from Flask and does not try to manage Webpack for you. Flask-WebpackExt does
        this via:
        
        * **Manifests**: You tell Webpack to write a ``manifest.json`` using plugins
          such as `webpack-manifest-plugin
          <https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-manifest-plugin>`_,
          `webpack-yam-plugin
          <https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-yam-plugin>`_ or
          `webpack-bundle-tracker
          <https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-tracker>`_. Flask-WebpackExt
          reads the manifest and makes your compiled assets available in your Jinja
          templates.
        * **CLI for NPM**: Flask-WebpackExt provides a Flask CLI so that e.g.
          ``flask webpack install`` will run ``npm install`` in your Webpack project.
          Similarly, ``flask webpack build`` will run ``npm run build``.
        
        Optionally you can use Flask-WebpackExt to also:
        
        * **Inject configuration:** Flask-WebpackExt will write a ``config.json`` into
          your Webpack project, which you can import in your Webpack configuration. You
          define what goes in the config e.g. Let Webpack know about output paths or
          dynamic entry points.
        * **Collect bundles:** If your Webpack project is spread over multiple Python
          packages, Flask-WebpackExt can help you dynamically assemble the files into a
          Webpack project. This is useful if you don't know until runtime which
          packages are installed.
