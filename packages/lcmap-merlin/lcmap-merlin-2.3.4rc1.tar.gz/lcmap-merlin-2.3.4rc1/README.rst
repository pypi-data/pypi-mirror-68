Merlin
======
A Python3 library for turning LCMAP spatial data into timeseries.

Features
--------
* Retrieve chips & chip specs
* Convert chips & chip specs into time series rods
* Many composable functions
* Works with symmetric or assymetric data arrays
* Built with efficiency in mind... leverages Numpy for heavy lifting.
* Tested with cPython 3.5 & 3.6


Example
-------
.. code-block:: python3

    import merlin

    timeseries = merlin.create(x=123,
                               y=456,
                               acquired='1980-01-01/2017-01-01',
                               cfg=merlin.cfg.get(profile='chipmunk-ard',
                                                  env={'CHIPMUNK_URL': 'http://localhost:5656'}))

    print(timeseries)

    (((123, 456, 123, 456), {'reds'  : [9, 8, ...],
                             'greens': [99, 88, ...]},
                             'blues' : [12, 22, ...],
                             'dates':  ['2017-01-01', '2016-12-31', ...]}),
     ((123, 456, 124, 456), {'reds'  : [4, 3, ...],
                             'greens': [19, 8, ...]},
                             'blues' : [1, 11, ...],
                             'dates':  ['2017-01-01', '2016-12-31', ...]}),)

Development
-----------

* A Conda environment is highly recommended.

.. code-block:: bash

    # generate build artifacts
    $ make build 

    # run all tests
    $ make tests

    # generate documentation
    $ make docs

    # push to pypi
    # expected env vars:
    # TWINE_USERNAME
    # TWINE_PASSWORD 
    $ make deploy

    # Releasing to Pypi
    # 1. increment version in setup.py
    # 2. git add *
    # 3. git commit -m 'add release message'
    # 4. git push
    # 5. git tag -a 1.2.3
    # 6. git push --tags
