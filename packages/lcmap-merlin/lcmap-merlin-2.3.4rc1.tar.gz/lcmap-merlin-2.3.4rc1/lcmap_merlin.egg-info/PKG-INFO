        Merlin
        ======
        A Python3 library for turning LCMAP spatial data into timeseries.
        
        Features
        --------
        * Retrieve chips & chip specs
        * Convert chips & chip specs into time series rods
        * Many composable functions
        * Works with symmetric or assymetric data arrays
        * Built with efficiency in mind... leverages Numpy for heavy lifting.
        * Tested with cPython 3.5 & 3.6
        
        
        Example
        -------
        .. code-block:: python3
        
            import merlin
        
            timeseries = merlin.create(x=123,
                                       y=456,
                                       acquired='1980-01-01/2017-01-01',
                                       cfg=merlin.cfg.get(profile='chipmunk-ard',
                                                          env={'CHIPMUNK_URL': 'http://localhost:5656'}))
        
            print(timeseries)
        
            (((123, 456, 123, 456), {'reds'  : [9, 8, ...],
                                     'greens': [99, 88, ...]},
                                     'blues' : [12, 22, ...],
                                     'dates':  ['2017-01-01', '2016-12-31', ...]}),
             ((123, 456, 124, 456), {'reds'  : [4, 3, ...],
                                     'greens': [19, 8, ...]},
                                     'blues' : [1, 11, ...],
                                     'dates':  ['2017-01-01', '2016-12-31', ...]}),)
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        * A Conda environment is highly recommended.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # generate build artifacts
            $ make build 
        
            # run all tests
            $ make tests
        
            # generate documentation
            $ make docs
        
            # push to pypi
            # expected env vars:
            # TWINE_USERNAME
            # TWINE_PASSWORD 
            $ make deploy
        
            # Releasing to Pypi
            # 1. increment version in setup.py
            # 2. git add *
            # 3. git commit -m 'add release message'
            # 4. git push
            # 5. git tag -a 1.2.3
            # 6. git push --tags
