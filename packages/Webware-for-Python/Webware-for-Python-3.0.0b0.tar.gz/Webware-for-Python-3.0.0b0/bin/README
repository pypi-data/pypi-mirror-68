ErrorMsgs directory
===================

This directory will contain error information captured by Webware while running
as a WSGI application. Each error is saved in its own HTML file. You can also
access these files through the application administration pages (e.g.,
http://localhost:8080/Admin/). You can choose a different location for this
directory by changing the "ErrorMessagesDir" setting in the configuration file
Configs/Application.config.

See the Webware documentation for more information.
