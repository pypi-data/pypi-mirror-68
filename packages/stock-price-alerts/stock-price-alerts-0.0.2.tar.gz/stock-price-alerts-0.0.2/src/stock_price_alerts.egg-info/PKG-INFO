Description: # stock-price-alerts
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alex4108/stock_price_alert_system.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alex4108/stock_price_alert_system)
        
        A script that can send alerts when a stock prices crosses a given threshold.
        
        # Installation
        1. `pip install stock-price-alerts`
        2. Copy `src/config_example.yml` to your machine
        3. Modify config_example.yml to your liking, rename it to what you wish.  See [Configuration]
        4. `stock-price-alerts --config /path/to/your/config.yml`
        
        # Configuration
        In `config_example.yml`, you can see a skeleton configuration.
        
        Configuration consists of 2 main parts:
        
        * ApplicationConfig
            * LogLevel: The desired verbosity of your logs
            * SlackAlert: For each object in the SlackAlert List, the script will end an alert to the Endpoint using the BotToken
            * SNSAlert: For each item in the SNSAlert List, an SMS will be sent using AWS SNS.
        
        * Symbols
            This is the bread and butter.  You configure symbols you want to watch, set the alarm tresholds, and set the Type of bitstamp or yahoo for the datasource.
            
        
        ## Alerts
        
        ### SNS Configuration
        
        This client can call Amazon Web Services Simple Notification Service (AWS SNS) to deliver a text message.
        This requires you to configure your `aws-cli` by executing `aws configure` and configuring the default profile with a set of keys generated by AWS IAM.
        
        ### Slack Configuration
        
        To set up the slack integration, create a slack app: `https://api.slack.com/apps`
        
        You want to implment "Permissions" on your app, specifically you want to add the Bot Token Scope, `chat:write`.  This is done under the `https://api.slack.com/apps/{your_app_id}/oauth?` page
        
        After you have enabled the chat:write permission, you'll install your app from the left hand menu.
        
        Once installed, grab your Bot User OAuth Access Token, and insert it to the `config.yml` as the `BotToken` parameter
        
        Then, configure your `Endpoint`.
        If your `Endpoint` is a USER, you must feed the Slack Member ID, see here: `https://help.workast.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027461274-How-to-find-a-Slack-user-ID`
        
        If your `Endpoint` is a channel, get the channel ID from your browser as discussed here: `https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Channel-ID-on-Slack-on-PC-or-Mac`
        
        # Requirements
        * Python >=3.6
        
        # Optional Parameters
        
        `--config [FILENAME]` defines an alertnate configuration file.  Default is config.yml
        
        `--sleep` amount of seconds to sleep between loops, if `--loop` is enabled.
        
        `--loop` causes the program to stay in an infinite loop.  requires a `--sleep` parameter
        
        ## Example Usage
        
        `stock-price-alerts --help`
        `stock-price-alerts --config /home/alex/stock-price-alerts.yml`
        `stock-price-alerts --loop --sleep 3600` to sleep 30 minutes between checks.
