        Python scripts using
        [Meld](https://meldmerge.org)
        to accomplish tasks useful for managing large numbers of repos / projects, particularly for templates.
        It works on any OS Meld works on (Linux, MacOS, Windows).
        
        ## Scripts
        
        ```sh
        meld_all project/myfile.f90 ~/code
        ```
        
        That terminal command invokes `meld` between `project/myfile.f90` and every other file with the same name found recursively under `~/code`.
        
        ### Usage
        
        Particularly on Windows, you may get Meld brought up and you don't see any difference.
        This is often because one file as a trailing \n and the other file does not, or the other file has \r\n.
        Meld won't show any difference, even with all text filters off.
        Because of how Python `filecmp.cmp` works, there isn't a blazing fast simple solution to this besides using str.replace, which I didn't want to do.
        
        So just realize it's OK, close Meld when it shows no difference and happy comparing!
