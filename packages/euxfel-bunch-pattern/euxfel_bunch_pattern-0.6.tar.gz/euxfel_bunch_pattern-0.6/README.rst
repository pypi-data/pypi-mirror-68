Encoding & decoding EuXFEL bunch pattern tables.
See `etc/Example.ipynb <https://github.com/European-XFEL/euxfel_bunch_pattern/blob/master/etc/Example.ipynb>`_
for examples of how to use it.

This package is mirrored from an `internal GitLab repository <https://git.xfel.eu/gitlab/karaboDevices/euxfel_bunch_pattern>`_
to a `public GitHub repository <https://github.com/European-XFEL/euxfel_bunch_pattern>`_.
This is one-way, so when we merge changes to master, we should push to GitLab.
