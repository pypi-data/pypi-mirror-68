# Health Updates

This is a python script that checks an API for COVID-19 case numbers for Mississippi and the US and outputs those numbers in the CovidDailyUpdate.txt as two paragraphs.

This command line script can be installed with '`pip install HealthUpdates`'. (For Windows users you may need to add the install location to your PATH.)

This script can be called with '`hupdates`' and will print the output to the CovidDailyUpdate.txt file.
