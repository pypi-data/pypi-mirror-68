        Everybody is welcome to use and/or develop oemof.solph. Read our `'Why should I contribute' <http://oemof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about_oemof.html#why-should-i-contribute>`_ section.
        
        Contribution is already possible on a low level by simply fixing typos in oemof's documentation or rephrasing sections which are unclear.

        Installation
        ============
        
        If you have a working Python3 environment, use pypi to install the latest oemof version. Python >= 3.5 is recommended. Lower versions may work but are not tested.
        
        
        ::
        
            pip install oemof.solph
        
        If you want to use the latest features, you might want to install the **developer version**. See section `'Developing oemof' <http://oemof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing_oemof.html>`_ for more information. The developer version is not recommended for productive use::
        
            pip install https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph/archive/dev.zip
        
        For more details have a look at the `'Installation and setup' <http://oemof-solph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_and_setup.html>`_ section.

        Open energy modelling framework (oemof)
        =======================================
        
        The oemof.solph package is part of the
        `Open energy modelling framework (oemof) <https://github.com/oemof/oemof>`_.
        This an organisational framework to bundle tools for energy (system) modelling.
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        The linkage of specific modules of the various packages is called an
        application (app) and depicts for example a concrete energy system model.
        You can find a large variety of helpful examples in `oemof's example repository <https://github.com/oemof/oemof_examples>`_ on github to download or clone. The examples show optimisations of different energy systems and are supposed to help new users to understand the framework's structure. There is some elaboration on the examples in the respective repository.
        
        You are welcome to contribute your own examples via a `pull request <https://github.com/oemof/examples/pulls>`_ or by sending us an e-mail (see `here <https://oemof.org/contact/>`_ for contact information).
