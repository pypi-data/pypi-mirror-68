"""This module defines classes to hold paired-comparison experimental data,
and methods and functions to read and write such data.
Data may be stored in various file formats.

*** Class Overview:

PairedCompFrame: defines layout of a paired-comparison experiment.
    Some properties of a PairedCompFrame instance can define selection criteria
    for a subset of data to be included for analysis.

pc_base.PairedCompItem: basic input file data block, specifying
    ONE response to ONE pair of test stimuli,
    by ONE subject, judging ONE perceptual attribute,
    in ONE test condition, defined by one category label for each Test Factor.

pc_base.PairedCompFile: interface to input data file in an allowed format,
    and iterator yielding PairedCompItem instances.

StimRespItem: container for a single stimulus, response, test-condition

PairedCompDataSet: all data for selected group(s), subjects, attributes, and test conditions,
    to be used as input for statistical analysis.
    Each subject should be tested in all (or most) test conditions,
    but not necessarily for all perceptual attributes.

*** Input File Formats:

* json: The simplest file structure is pc_file_json.PairedCompFile.
This is just a serialized sequence of PairedCompItem objects.
Files in this format must be saved with extension '.json'.

* xlsx: Data can be imported from Excel workbook (xlsx) files,
with data stored in one or more worksheets, in a quite flexible format.
Files in this format must be saved with extension '.xlsx'.

Data elements are stored in specified locations,
as defined by keyword parameters to the pc_file_xlsx.PairedCompFile object.
See module pc_file_xlsx for details.

* res: For backward compatibility,
input data files may also be stored in an older text format,
used by Dahlquist and Leijon (2003).
Files in this format are saved with extension '.res'.
See module pc_file_res for details.


*** Input Data Files:

All input files from an experiment must be stored in one directory tree.

If results are to be analyzed for more than one group of test subjects,
the data for each group must be stored in separate sub-directory trees
on the first level just below the top directory.
All sub-directories in the tree are searched recursively for data files.

Each data file may contain paired-comparison results
for one or more test subjects judging one or more perceptual attributes,
in one or more test conditions.
File names are arbitrary, although they may be somehow associated with
the encoded name of the participant, to facilitate data organisation.

Files for different test conditions may be stored in separate sub-directories.
The directory name can then be used to indicate some test-factor categories,
if the test-factor is not defined within the data file itself.

Several files may include data for the same subject,
e.g., results obtained in different test conditions,
or simply for replicated test sessions with the same subject.


*** Example Directory Tree:

Assume we have data files in the following directory structure:
~/pc_data / NH / Low,   containing files Subject0.json, ..., Subject20.json
~/pc_data / NH / High,  containing files Subject0.json, ..., Subject20.json
~/pc_data / HI / Low,  containing files test0.json, ..., test10.json
~/pc_data / HI / High, containing files test0.json, ..., test10.json

Directories 'NH' and 'HI' may contain data for different groups of test participants,
e.g, individuals with normal hearing (NH) or with impaired hearing (HI).

Sub-directories named 'Low' and 'High' may include data files collected
in two different noise conditions, with 'Low' or 'High' signal-to-noise ratio,
in case the noise condition is not recorded by some field the file itself.

Data files for the SAME subjects should then be found in BOTH sub-directories 'Low' and 'High'.
because each subject should be tested in both test conditions.

If tests have been done for different perceptual Attributes,
each subject should ideally be tested with all Attributes,
to allow the most accurate estimation of correlations between Attributes.


*** Accessing Input Data fÃ¶r Analysis:

*1: Create a PairedCompFrame object defining the experimental layout, e.g., as:
pcf = PairedCompFrame(objects = ['testA', 'testB', 'testC'],  # three sound processors
        attributes = ['Preference'],  # only a single perceptual attribute in this case
        test_factors = {'Sound': ['speech', 'music'],  # test factor 'Sound' with two categories
                        'SNR': ['Low', 'High']}  #  test factor 'SNR' with two categories
        )
NOTE: attribute labels must be strings that can be used as directory names.
NOTE: Letter CASE is distinctive, i.e., 'Low' and 'low' are different categories.

*2: Load all test results into a PairedCompDataSet object:

ds = PairedCompDataSet.load(pcf, dir='~/pc_data', groups=['NH', 'HI'], fmt='json')

The loaded data structure ds can then be used as input for analysis.

If fmt='xlsx' is specified, the load method reads only files with the 'xlsx' extension
in the directory tree defined by the top-directory path-string in parameter dir.

If the fmt argument is left unspecified, or if fmt=None, or fmt='',
PairedCompDataSet.load will attempt to read ALL files in the designated directory tree,
and use the files that seem to contain paired-comparison data.

The parameter groups is an optional list of sub-directory names,
one for each participant group.

The parameter pcf is a PairedCompFrame object that defines the experimental layout.
Some properties of this object can define selection criteria
for a subset of data to be included for analysis.

With data files saved in the 'json' or 'xlsx' formats,
the test-factor categories may be defined in the file.
If so, the sub-directory names 'Low' and 'High' are not significant,
and need not agree with any test-condition labels in the PairedCompFrame object.

However, if a desired test factor is NOT defined in the file data,
the file-reading methods will attempt to find that test-factor category
as a sub-string of the full path string.

Files in the older 'res' format can NOT define test conditions.
For these files all test factors must be derived from the path-string.

Therefore, in this case the category labels defined for test-factors
MUST be UNIQUE in the file paths.
For example, test_factors = {'SNR': ['Low', 'High', 'Higher']}
can NOT be used if the categories are defined by the path string.
Test-condition labels can not be sub-strings of a group name,
because the group directory name is also included in the path-string.

*** Selecting Subsets of Data for Analysis:

It is possible to define a data set including only a subset of experimental data.
For example, assume we want to analyse only group 'HI':

ds_HI = PairedCompDataSet.load(pcf, dir='~/pc_data', groups=['HI'])

Or perhaps we want to look at results for only one test condition,
and only two of the three sound objects that have been tested.
Then we must define a new PairedCompFrame object before loading the data:

small_pcf = PairedCompFrame(objects = ['testA', 'testB'],  # only two of the sound processors
        attributes = ['Preference'],  # same single perceptual attribute
        test_factors = {'SNR': ['High']}  # test factor SNR, now with only ONE category
        )
ds_AB_HI_High = PairedCompDataSet.load(small_pcf, dir='~/pc_data', groups =  ['HI'])

This will include all data with SNR='High', regardless of other test-factors.

If there are data for other perceptual attributes in addition to 'Preference',
the analysis is restricted to the specified subset of attributes.

Any paired-comparisons for OTHER OBJECTS, not explicitly named in small_pcf, will be DISREGARDED.
Any results for OTHER ATTRIBUTES, not explicitly specified in small_pcf, will be DISREGARDED.
Any results having a desired test-factor category will be INCLUDED,
regardless of the category within any other test factor.

*** Version History:
