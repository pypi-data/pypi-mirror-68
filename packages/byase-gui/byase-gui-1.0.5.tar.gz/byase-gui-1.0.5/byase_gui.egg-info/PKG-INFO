Description: # BYASE-GUI
        
        A GUI (Graphical User Interface) tool for BYASE software.
        
        ## Installation
        
        BYASE-GUI is built using the [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) 
        framework, in order to successfully compile the package 
        `wxPython`, some system libraries should be pre-installed. 
        For example, on **Ubuntu 18.04**, these libraries may need 
        to be installed:
        ```shell
        sudo apt install libgtk-3-0 libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev freeglut3-dev libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev
        ```
        The package `pathlib2` may also need to be installed:
        ```shell
        pip3 install --user pathlib2
        ```
        Then BYASE-GUI can be installed by:
        ```shell
        pip3 install --user byase-gui
        ```
        This will automatically install `byase`, 
        `wxPython` and `psutil`.
